Hi there! I’m Yvonne Villarreal, TV writer for The Times and co-host of “The Envelope” podcast. I’m a devotee of period drama, and “Bridgerton” has delivered on all the familiar tropes I love: elaborate costumes, extravagant balls and, of course, a steamy romance. But what made the show’s second season really special was Kate Sharma, an intelligent, self-assured romantic lead  and a role written and consciously cast for an Indian woman. In this episode of “The Envelope,” I got to talk to Simone Ashley, who plays Kate, about the joys and responsibilities that come with on-screen representation, why it was important to portray Kate as a flawed character still worthy of love, and how her upbringing led her to dream big. Listen wherever you get your podcasts or on latimes.com, where you can also read the full transcript. Thanks, and happy listening!

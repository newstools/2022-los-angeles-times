The dark, inky sweetness of blackberries pairs beautifully with a refreshingly bitter shot of amaro in this grown-up berry jelly. Chopped green apples are added to the berries to provide pectin, which helps set the jelly with its characteristic wobbliness. I prefer amaro Montenegro or Lucano to pair with blackberries, but virtually any amaro that’s not aggressively bitter or too menthol-forward will work. This amount of amaro gives the jelly a back note of bitterness but is not overtly present. If you want a more boozy jelly, add up to an extra ¼ cup but allow the jelly to boil for 30 seconds after you add it so the amaro doesn’t throw off the final set texture.

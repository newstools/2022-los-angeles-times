A 300-pound bear was struck and killed Monday morning on the 210  Freeway in Irwindale, authorities said. The crash happened around 4:15 a.m. on the westbound  connector road to the southbound 605 Freeway, when an SUV hit the bear, California Highway Patrol Officer Ramon Kendricks said. The CHP  told KTLA-TV that several cars swerved to avoid hitting the bear. The bear was eventually removed from the freeway on a flat-bed tow truck, Kendricks said. He said he didn’t know whether anyone in the vehicle was injured in the crash. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

To the editor: Regardless of your stance on abortion, there is a crisis in our country under the surface. Solving this crisis is commonsense and represents the best interests of both political parties as well as all American women and children. I offer you three scenarios, currently unfolding in our country at this very moment, that must be solved now with commonsense measures: I beseech our elected officials to come together with women’s health professionals to immediately clear up these and other cases. There are no children without women, so being “pro-life” starts with protecting mothers. Denise Woods, Long Beach

Huntington Beach hosted what organizers called the “largest gathering of Black surfers in history,” with a morning surf competition entry, free yoga lessons, and free surf lessons. The inaugural  event, called A Great Day in the Stoke, was designed to  create a safe space for Black surfers to connect and compete, recognize and award leaders in the community, provide free surf lessons, and capture a group photo similar to “A Great Day in Harlem” (1958) and “A Great Day in Hip-Hop” (1998). A Great Day in the Stoke  was intended to inspire the Black community to feel welcome in the water and to experience and share the joy of surfing the waves safely as well as paying homage to veteran Black surfers who have been surfing since the 1950s.

After over 10 months of working behind closed doors, the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol is starting to put its cards on the table at a series of televised hearings this month. The first session aired Thursday at 5 p.m. Pacific time — notably, during prime time on the East Coast. It was one of six televised hearings planned on the committee’s investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the nation’s Capitol. Over the coming weeks, the nine-member committee will attempt to reconstruct the days leading up to the insurrection, which followed former President Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. The panel has gathered more than 1,000 depositions and countless documents.

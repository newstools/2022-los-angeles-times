Prolific architect Richard Landry has designed homes for countless stars: Tom Brady, Mark Wahlberg, Sylvester Stallone, Dr. Dre and Kylie Jenner, to name a few. But the house he custom-built for himself in Brentwood might be the most stylish of them all. The architectural estate, which fuses French, English and California contemporary styles, just sold in an off-market deal for $19.5 million. Landry picked up the empty property for $5.1 million in 2015 and spent the next few years designing and building the one-of-a-kind residence. In an interview with Luxe, he declared the home a compromise: dramatic, contemporary features for him surrounded by stately, traditional spaces for his husband, Chris Drugan. The result is a tangle of influences, an entirely unique creation with feet that straddle different centuries and styles. The dichotomy begins outside,  where a stainless-steel cube covered in metallic paint slices across a traditional brick façade. Inside, steel beams cut through skylights that top a two-story atrium. The main level also includes an indoor-outdoor dining room, colorful kitchen with two marble islands and masculine office bathed in shades of gray. “The attention to detail in this home is unlike anything I have ever seen,” said Morgan Trent of the Aaron Kirman Group at Compass, who shared the listing with Aaron Kirman. Six bedrooms and eight bathrooms fill out the 9,500-square-foot floor plan. Another highlight comes downstairs, where a game room with an extravagant wet bar features murals, coved ceilings and polished concrete floors.  Walls of glass open to the outdoors,  where hedges and citrus trees surround a metallic sculpture. Out back, a covered lounge leads to a swimming pool and spa. At $19.5 million, it’s one of the priciest sales in Brentwood so far this year and the highest sale ever in the South of San Vicente neighborhood, according to the Multiple Listing Service.

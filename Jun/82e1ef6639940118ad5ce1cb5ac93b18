Evacuation orders were lifted Wednesday night as firefighters stopped forward progress on a brush fire that broke out in the Angeles National Forest, prompting road closures in portions of northwestern Los Angeles County. The fire, which started Wednesday afternoon, was holding at about 11 acres with at least 50% containment, according to a statement by the Angeles National Forest shortly before 9 p.m. “The evacuation order was rescinded,” officials said. “However, the road closure remains in place with police escort for residents only.” Bouquet Canyon Road was temporarily closed between Spunky Canyon and Plume roads, forest officials said earlier in the day, adding “this will affect commuters who use this road to commute between the edge of Santa Clarita Valley and Lancaster/Palmdale.”  The U.S. Forest Service first reported a fire in the area of Bouquet Canyon and Spunky Canyon around 3:15 p.m. Within an hour, officials said, the blaze — dubbed the Sierra fire — had grown to at least 10 acres. “Forward progress stopped at 11 acres, structure threat mitigated,” the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department’s Santa Clarita Valley station tweeted Wednesday evening. There were 250 firefighters on scene, six helicopters and three air tankers.   About 10 homes were evacuated earlier Wednesday, officials with the sheriff’s station said. Footage captured by KABC-TV Channel 7 showed aerial crews dropping water and retardant on the flames.  The blaze was the second to ignite within the Angeles National Forest this week. The Sheep fire sparked Saturday in San Bernardino County and grew to about 865 acres by Wednesday, when officials said it was 81% contained.

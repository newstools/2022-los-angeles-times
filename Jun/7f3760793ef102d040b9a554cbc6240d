Hello, it’s Erin B. Logan with a special report on a seismic decision Friday out of Washington. The Supreme Court overturned the landmark abortion Roe vs. Wade decision, ruling that states may outlaw abortion — a decision certain to spark fierce political and legal battles across the country over efforts to restrict or ban the procedure. The opinion marks the first time in the court’s history that the court has so significantly curtailed an established constitutional right. The decision, penned by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., mostly tracks the draft opinion that was leaked and published by Politico early last month, empowering states to further restrict and prohibit abortion. If you want to learn more about the ruling from the best Supreme Court writer in the business, read this smart take by The Times’ David G. Savage. The court’s most conservative justices joined forces to accomplish a long-sought goal of overturning Roe vs. Wade, which in 1972 established the right to an abortion. In recent decades, conservatives have steadily chipped away at Roe and have sought to appoint judges to the federal courts who would be willing to toss it aside. Dissenting were the court’s three liberal justices. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. concurred but did not join the majority opinion. Opinion polls show most Americans support access to abortion, at least in the early months of pregnancy, but half the states are expected to seek to enforce laws that make most abortions illegal. I know it’s a lot to digest.

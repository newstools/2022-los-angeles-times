Anthony Rendon’s season is officially over. The Angels’ injured third baseman, who reaggravated his ailing right wrist Tuesday, will have season-ending surgery early next week, the team said in a statement Friday. The Angels, who signed Rendon to a seven-year, $245-million deal with a no-trade clause before the 2020 season, will be without him for the majority of a second straight season. In the 45 games he played in 2022, he logged 37 hits, 15 runs, five home runs, 24 RBIs and 23 walks. Rendon informed interim manager Phil Nevin of his wrist being increasingly uncomfortable after his at-bat in the fourth inning of Tuesday’s game. They pulled him from the game before the bottom of the fifth inning, replacing him at third with Matt Duffy. The two-time Silver Slugger said his fielding and batting was affected by discomfort in his wrist. But a lengthy downtime was not discussed by Nevin and athletic trainer Mike Frostad on Tuesday. By Wednesday, there was optimism that, with rest, Rendon’s wrist could improve.  He traveled with the team to Seattle for a five-game series with the Mariners and was still listed as available off the bench in the opener Thursday. Nevin and Frostad both acknowledged Wednesday that Rendon had been playing with a nagging wrist issue that required daily evaluation.   “I appreciate what he’s doing trying to go out there for his club,” Nevin said before Wednesday’s Freeway Series finale at Dodger Stadium. “It’s really like how he’s functioning and the function’s not great right now, but it changes throughout the day.” Frostad said Rendon’s ability to keep playing with the bothersome wrist would depend on his pain tolerance. Nevin and Frostad alluded to potentially talking to Rendon about putting him on the injured list if didn’t feel better during the Seattle trip.

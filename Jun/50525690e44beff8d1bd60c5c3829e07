The prevailing thought among NBA scouts is that there is a consensus top three for the draft, which will start at 5 p.m. PDT on Thursday at the Barclays Center in New York. But starting with the fourth pick, the draft could go any direction. That’s because the Sacramento Kings have the fourth pick and are looking to move it for an “NBA-ready veteran” player, according to people with knowledge of the situation. The New York Knicks, Washington Wizards and Atlanta Hawks have interest in Sacramento’s fourth selection. This is a look at how things might shake out in the first round. The Lakers and Clippers do not have first-round picks. 1. Orlando: Jabari Smith, 19, PF, 6-10, Auburn Though young, his size, length and athletic ability are intriguing. 2. Oklahoma City: Chet Holmgren, 20, F/C, 7-0, Gonzaga Agile for his size, he can shoot and has good ball-handling skills. His weight (195 pounds) is worrisome. 3. Houston: Paolo Banchero, 19, PF, 6-10, Duke Considered to be NBA-ready. Can pass and score. But how much better can he be? 4. Sacramento: Jaden Ivey, 20, SG, 6-4, Purdue He’s aggressive and explosive. It’s likely the Kings trade the pick to a team needing backcourt help. 5. Detroit: Shaedon Sharpe, 18, G, 6-6, Kentucky Great fit next to point guard Cade Cunningham to give Pistons a backcourt of the future. 6. Indiana: Keegan Murray, 21, F, 6-8, Iowa Nice mid-range game and can put ball on the floor to score off the drive. 7. Portland: Dyson Daniels, 19, G, 6-8, G League Ignite Has really good point guard skills and is a really good defender, on and off ball. 8. New Orleans: Bennedict Mathurin, 19, G, 6-6, Arizona Has good size for a shooting guard and is a good defender. 9. San Antonio: Ousmane Dieng, 19, F, 6-9, France Has been impressive in workouts during draft process, moving him up. 10. Washington: Johnny Davis, 20, G, 6-5, Wisconsin A slasher who is tough and can defend, but needs to improve three-point stroke. 11. New York: A.J. Griffin, 18, F, 6-6, Duke Perhaps the best pure shooter in the draft, he’s a natural scorer. 12. Oklahoma City: Blake Wesley, 19, G, 6-5, Notre Dame He is super explosive with plenty of athleticism and scoring ability. 13. Charlotte: Jeremy Sochan, 19, F, 6-9, Baylor His seven-foot wingspan helps make him a good defender. 14. Cleveland: Malaki Branham, 19, F, 6-5, Ohio State Has a strong work ethic and ability to score in a variety of ways. 15. Charlotte: Mark Williams, 20, C, 7-0, Duke Was a top rim protector in the NCAA last season. 16. Atlanta: Jalen Duren, 18, C, 6-11, Memphis Not a bad rim protector, but Hawks probably willing to move this pick. 17. Houston: Ochai Agbaji, 22, G/F, 6-5, Kansas He’s more of a small forward who needs to improve ball-handling skills. 18. Chicago: Tari Eason, 21, F, 6-8, Louisiana State A defensive-minded player who is raw offensively. 19. Minnesota: TyTy Washington, 20, G, 6-3, Kentucky Could add depth to Timberwolves’ talented backcourt. 20. San Antonio: Kennedy Chandler, 19, PG, 6-0, Tennessee He’s super-fast and can score. 21.Denver: Jalen Williams, 21, G/F, 6-6, Santa Clara His size and strength make him a good defender. 22. Memphis: MarJon Beauchamp, 21, F, 6-6, G League Ignite Long and athletic, a driver and slasher. 23. Philadelphia: Jaden Hardy, 19, G, 6-4, G League Ignite Is a talented scorer with handles who can shoot the three-pointer. 24. Milwaukee: Nikola Jovic, 18, F, 6-10, Serbia Has really good ball skills and is athletic. 25. San Antonio: E.J. Liddell, 21, F, 6-7, Ohio State Undersized power forward, but is strong and tough. 26. Houston: Wendell Moore, 20, F, 6-5, Duke Likes to drive to the basket. 27. Miami: Dalen Terry, 19, G, 6-7, Arizona Good size for a point guard who looks to pass first. 28. Golden State: Walker Kessler, 20, C, 7-1, Auburn Has size, but what does that matter to the NBA champions? 29. Memphis: Patrick Baldwin, 19, F, 6-9, Milwaukee Has the skills to be a stretch-four. 30. Denver: John Butler, 19, F/C, 7-1, Florida State Has good shooting range for his size and length.

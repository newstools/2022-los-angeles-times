A man was struck and killed Thursday morning in South Los Angeles by a driver in a reported stolen car who was being pursued by police, authorities said. Officers with the Los Angeles Police Department attempted to stop  the driver  around 12:30 a.m. in the Florence neighborhood. The driver did not pull over and the officers initiated  a pursuit but called it off two minutes later when the driver began to drive erratically and at dangerous speeds on  surface streets, according to Officer Annie Hernandez. The LAPD continued  to track the driver by air. But near the intersection of Florence and South Central avenues, the stolen car  struck the pedestrian,  a man in his 50s  who may have been trying to cross the street, police said. The man, who was not identified,  died at the scene, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The driver’s vehicle was damaged in the collision with the pedestrian and after striking another vehicle on the street, Hernandez said. The driver, identified only as a 42-year-old woman,  was taken to a local hospital after complaining of pain after the crash, Hernandez said. After she is treated, she will be transported to jail for booking. It’s unclear what charges she will face in connection with the stolen vehicle, the pursuit and the pedestrian’s death.

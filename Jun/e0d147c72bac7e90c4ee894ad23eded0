A pedestrian was struck by three hit-and-run drivers and  pronounced dead Monday morning in Fullerton, authorities said. The Fullerton Police Department was  first notified of the fatal crash at around 1:30 a.m. The incident occurred at the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Southgate Avenue. Police said they arrived on the scene and found a pedestrian lying on the street with his belongings. He had serious, life-threatening injuries. The 38-year-old victim was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to police. The victim was identified as  Kenneth Edward Wassennar II, a resident of Fullerton who is believed to have been homeless, according to the Orange County coroner’s office.  Police said the man was pushing a shopping cart through the crosswalk on the northern part of the intersection, westbound across Harbor Boulevard, against a red light. Reports indicate the victim was first struck by a white Dodge Charger, which  was passing the intersection and traveling on a green light south on Harbor Boulevard. The driver did not stop. Seconds later, a black Jeep Wrangler, also traveling south, struck the man and also did not stop, police said. About two minutes later, the third car, a white, two-door Honda Civic traveling in the same direction, hit the pedestrian a third time and also failed to stop, according to police.

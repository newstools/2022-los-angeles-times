Drivers in Los Angeles can expect increased traffic and several road closures this week as President Biden and leaders from the Western Hemisphere gather in the city for the ninth Summit of the Americas, officials said. The United States is hosting the gathering for the second time since 1994, drawing world leaders from North, Central and South America from June 6 to 10, officials said. Traffic is expected to slow in downtown L.A. and near Los Angeles International Airport from 10 p.m. Monday to noon Saturday, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office. The mayor’s office suggested that drivers avoid the areas between the 10 and 101 freeways and west of the 110 Freeway. “We’re thrilled to host the ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles and to welcome leaders from across the Western Hemisphere here to focus on our shared goal to secure a sustainable, resilient and equitable future for all our peoples,” Garcetti said in a statement. On Thursday, one southbound traffic lane on Pacific Coast Highway — from Coastline Drive to the Santa Monica tunnel — will be dedicated to emergency vehicles from noon to 10 p.m. From 10 p.m. Monday to noon Saturday, commuters should avoid: Several other downtown L.A. roads will be intermittently closed to traffic as the summit progresses.  Drivers can access the downtown area via the following freeway exits: Businesses on those streets will stay open and foot traffic will be allowed. On public transit, detours are likely for Dash routes A, B, E and F, as well as Commuter Express lines 409, 419, 422, 423, 431, 437, 438, 439, 448, 534, and the Union Station/Bunker Hill shuttle and some stops will temporarily close.

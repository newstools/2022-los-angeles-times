Firefighters are battling multiple wildfires in Northern California that prompted evacuations Thursday afternoon. Evacuation orders for residents in the Sunol community of Alameda County near Pleasanton were lifted by about 7:30 p.m. as fire crews slowed the spread of the Canyon fire. The blaze covered 71 acres of grass and brush, and it was 10% contained as of 9 p.m., according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. In Contra Costa County, residents also faced evacuation orders and road closures due to the Scenic fire, which had grown to 140 acres in the Port Costa area and was 10% contained by 9 p.m., according to Cal Fire. Evacuation orders for that fire were also lifted Thursday evening, Contra Costa County officials said. And in Solano County, the Timm fire near Vacaville started Thursday afternoon and was 26 acres and 80% contained as of 8 p.m., according to Cal Fire. Later Thursday, a second vegetation fire erupted in unincorporated Alameda County. The Tesla fire east of Livermore had grown to 300 acres with 10% containment by 9 p.m., according to Cal Fire. The afternoon sea breeze was pushing winds through the region, said Brooke Bingaman, senior forecaster with the National Weather Service in the Bay Area. But that breeze was also bringing more humidity, which could help firefighters contain the blazes. “It’s a mixed bag,” Bingaman said. Winds were expected to die down Thursday evening, she said.

Finish your breakfast so I can drop you off. Did you make up your bed yet? (But I am not coming back) Are you ready to go to school? When you come home today, I want you to clean your room. (But I am not coming back) I know that I don’t say this too often, but I love you and I am proud of your grades. Your father and I want to take you out to a restaurant to show our appreciation next week. (But I am not coming back) Have a nice day at school. I will pick you up later to go to softball practice. (But I am not coming back) I am at work. I am leaving you a message on your cellphone to tell you that I am going to be late picking you up. (But I am not coming back) Why is your room empty? I miss that laugh. The way you look at me when we have fun together. Please come back to us. We feel empty without you. (I want to come back.) I am going to miss you. You have been great parents to me. I celebrated Mother’s Day and wanted to celebrate Father’s Day as well. It is not fair. I want everything back to the way it was. I want to come back.

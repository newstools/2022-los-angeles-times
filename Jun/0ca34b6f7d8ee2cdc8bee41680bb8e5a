The land of liberty, my native country, can’t claim to have invented the hot dog, but we did invent the corn dog. Carl and Neil Fletcher were the first people to deep-fry hot dogs in cornbread batter, a concoction invented and sold as “Fletcher’s Corny Dogs” at the State Fair of Texas  in 1942. You’ll need  six wooden skewers to make this recipe.

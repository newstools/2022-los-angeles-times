A father and his 10-year-old son were found dead Tuesday night in Chatsworth in what authorities are calling a possible murder-suicide. The pair were found around 8:30 p.m. near a vehicle in the 21000 block of Plummer Street, according to Officer Lizeth Lomeli of the Los Angeles Police Department.  The L.A. County coroner’s office on Wednesday identified them as Jose Romo Guerra, 35, and his 10-year-old son, Michael Romo Sandoval, both of Canoga Park. Autopsies were pending and additional details were not released. LAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton told reporters Tuesday night that the incident is being investigated as a possible murder-suicide. “At this point we suspect that is a possibility,” he said. “We have not verified anything at this point regarding the nature of the death of the two individuals.” Hamilton provided no information about a weapon or manner of death. He said the two were not discovered inside a vehicle but “very near a vehicle that has been identified as potentially belonging to one of the individuals.”  He said the investigation is ongoing. “It’s tragic,” he said. “We have two individuals that are out here, they are deceased, and we are going to get to the bottom of it.” No additional information was immediately available.

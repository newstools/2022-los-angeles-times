Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and there’s no sugarcoating it. The Dodgers are struggling. The question is, will it continue, or will they pull out of it? That answer depends on whether you are an optimist (yes they will), a pessimist (no they won’t) or a realist (there’s no way to know) and reveals more about you than it does the Dodgers. So, there was good news and bad news for the Dodgers recently. Let’s go over it. Good news: Walker Buehler won’t need Tommy John surgery. Bad news: Buehler probably will be out until at least late August with a strained ligament in his pitching elbow. He will be shut down for a minimum of six weeks, and then his arm strength will have to be built back up again. Bad news: The Dodgers were swept by the Giants. Bad news: Mookie Betts is two for his last 31, with one walk. Bad news: Justin Turner is hitting .213. Bad news: Cody Bellinger is hitting .207. Bad news: Freddie Freeman is hitting .229/.245/.333 in June. Bad news: The Dodgers have lost nine of their last 13. Bad news: The rotation is now Clayton Kershaw, Julio Urías, Tony Gonsolin, Tyler Anderson and probably Mitch White. Bad news: Urías gave up 19 homers in 185-2/3 innings last season. He has given up 12 in 64-1/3 innings this season. Good news: The Dodgers lead the majors in averaging 5.15 runs per game. Bad news: The Dodgers are averaging 3.55 runs per game in June.  Bad news: The Dodgers have forgotten how to draw walks. They have a team on-base percentage of .299 in June and are averaging 2.9 walks per game, compared to 4.1 in April and 4.3 in May. Bad news: The Dodgers went two for 24 with runners in scoring position against the Giants. Bad news: The Dodgers’ bullpen ERA in June is 5.40. Bad news: Craig Kimbrel has given up a run in seven of his last 10 games.  Amazingly, he still has only one blown save this season. In case you were wondering, Kenley Jansen has given up a run in four of his last 10 games  and has three blown saves this season. But even with all the bad news, there’s something even more frustrating: The Dodgers give the appearance of a team going through the motions the last couple of weeks. The extra hustle, the alert, smart baseball just isn’t on display. This is a time when you wish they had a guy like Kirk Gibson, who would call a team meeting and try to shake everyone awake. Dave Roberts said before Sunday’s game: “People get caught up in their own individual paths, but the whole focusing on just winning a game and doing whatever it takes to win that day, we have to get back to that mindset. ... I just think the urgency to do whatever it takes to win that night on the offensive side hasn’t been there. It’s not a lack of care. It’s not a lack of try. But the mindset has to get back to whatever it takes to win a game.” Justin Turner, when informed of Roberts’ comments, said, “I don’t know what that means. I don’t think we’re doing anything differently. Go out and you set the table and try to come up with a big hit, and [we] just didn’t.” Few things will upset Dodgers fans more than getting swept by the Giants. The Dodgers need to show that it upsets them too. Starting tonight against the Angels. John J. Sax, the son of former Dodger Steve Sax, was killed along with four others when their Marine Osprey aircraft crashed last week in the Imperial County desert. “It is with complete devastation that I announce that my precious son, Johnny, was one of the five U.S. Marines that perished on Wednesday, June 8, in the Osprey Military crash near San Diego,” Steve said in a statement. “For those of you that knew Johnny, you saw his huge smile, bright light, his love for his family, the Marines, the joy of flying airplanes and defending our country. He was my hero and the best man I know, there was no better person to defend our country. There was never any doubt from a young age that Johnny would be a pilot and his passion was to fly. This loss will change my life forever and is a loss to not only the Marines but this world.” Sax, 33, of Placer, Calif., was one of two pilots killed, along with Capt. Nicholas P. Losapio, 31, of Rockingham, N.H., and tiltrotor crew chiefs Cpl. Nathan E. Carlson, 21, of Winnebago, Ill., Cpl. Seth D. Rasmuson, 21, of Johnson, Wyo., and Lance Cpl. Evan A. Strickland, 19, of Valencia, N.M. The Marines were based at Camp Pendleton and assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 364 of Marine Aircraft Group 39, part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing headquartered at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. And that certainly puts a tough two weeks for the Dodgers in the proper perspective.  Up next in our “Ask...” series is former Dodger Shawn Green, who had perhaps the greatest offensive day in history when he went six for six with four homers, a single and a double, along with six runs scored and seven RBIs, against the Milwaukee Brewers on May 23, 2002. Green is still the Dodgers single-season home run leader, with 49 in 2001. He played with the team from 2000-04. Green will answer selected questions from Dodgers Dugout readers. Send in your questions for Green by emailing me at houston.mitchell@latimes.com.  The Dodgers are playing the Angels next.

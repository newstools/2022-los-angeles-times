My favorite thing on the Dem Bones menu, other than the sweet potato pie from 27th Street Bakery, has to be my grandpa’s slow-cooked beans. I don’t know his recipe specifically but over the years, I’ve found something that brings my memories close. Make sure to stir periodically so the beans don’t stick to the bottom.

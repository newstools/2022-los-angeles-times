One person was injured Saturday in a shooting aboard a BART train in Oakland, transit officials said. The incident was reported just before 1 p.m. on a San Francisco-bound train as it reached the West Oakland station, Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said. A male patient was  taken to a  hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. The BART train on which the shooting occurred was removed from service to a maintenance yard for the investigation. BART officials said  no suspect was in custody. The incident was the second reported on a Bay Area public transit line this week. Wednesday morning, one person was killed and another injured in a shooting  aboard a Muni Metro train in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. The shooting reportedly arose out of an argument, city officials said.

The pilot was killed when a small plane crashed into a strawberry field in Ventura County early Friday and immediately became engulfed in flames, authorities said. The crash occurred about 8 a.m. in the field on the north side of Highway 101 near Oxnard, according to the Ventura County Fire Department. The plane reportedly struck a building on the south side of highway before crashing into the field. Firefighters extinguished the fire by 8:40 a.m., and all lanes of Highway 101 remain open, according to Andy VanSciver, spokesperson for the Fire Department. No additional details were available about the  pilot. It did not appear any other passengers were on board, the Fire Department stated. The crash involved a single-engine, four-seat plane that took off from the nearby Camarillo Airport at 7:59 a.m, authorities confirmed. The plane was listed on a flight tracking site FlightAware as a Mooney M-20 Turbo that was destined for Phoenix, Ariz. “Our thoughts are with the family,” said Dave Nafie, deputy director of airports for Ventura County. “We’re pleased no one on the ground was hurt.” The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

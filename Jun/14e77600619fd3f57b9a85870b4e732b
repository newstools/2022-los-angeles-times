A heat advisory was issued for inland areas of Southern California for Sunday and Monday, with temperatures in many areas hitting the triple-digit mark. Highs will reach 95-105 degrees in the San Fernando, San Gabriel and Antelope valleys as well as inland Orange County and part of the Inland Empire. Most coastal areas are expected to remain relatively cool. “Monday is supposed to be the warmest day, but Tuesday and Wednesday will still be warm,” said John Dumas, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. Downtown Los Angeles will see highs in the low 90s on Monday, or about 10 degrees above normal. Further inland, the highs will be closer to 15 degrees above normal, Dumas said. The hot, dry weather will bring elevated fire conditions, but high winds — which can critically boost the fire threat — are unlikely to be an issue early in the week. Dumas said winds may approach advisory levels in certain areas later in the week. The heat wave came amid several fires over the last few days, the largest in Riverside County. Evacuation warnings for that Jurupa Valley brush fire were lifted Sunday morning.   “Our main message this week is heat safety,” Dumas said, urging residents to “take an extra lookout for the people or pets who are at higher risk for heat problems.”  A map of cooling centers in Los Angeles County can be found here. “Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors. Young children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances,” the National Weather Service advised. “Take extra precautions if you work or spend time outside. When possible reschedule strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Know the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing when possible.”

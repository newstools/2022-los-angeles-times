Viewership for Thursday’s coverage of the House Select Committee’s hearing on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was the most-watched prime-time program since President Biden’s State of the Union address March 1. The approximately two-hour hearing averaged 20.043 million viewers on the 11 networks where figures were available, according to Nielsen. The figure did not include viewership on PBS due to PBS data delivery timing. The State of the Union address averaged 38.197 million viewers on 16 networks. The individual ratings were led by ABC’s coverage, which averaged 5.216 million viewers, fifth for the week. MSNBC’s second hour of coverage was the week’s top-ranked prime-time cable program, averaging 4.42 million viewers, sixth for the week. Fox News Channel aired its customary weeknight lineup of political talk shows  while broadcasting the hearing on Fox Business Network. ABC’s coverage of Game 4 of the NBA Finals was second for the week, with the Golden State Warriors’ 107-97 victory over the Boston Celtics Friday averaging a series-high 12.063 million viewers. Boston’s 116-100 Game 3 victory two nights earlier finished third, averaging 11.523 million viewers. The NBA finals is averaging 11.725 million viewers, the lowest when held during their customary time since 2007, but 26% higher than the 9.303 million average for the first four games of the series between the Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns, which were played in July. For the second time in the two full weeks of television’s summer season, NBC’s “America’s Got Talent” was the top-ranked entertainment program, averaging 6.372 million viewers, third for the week.

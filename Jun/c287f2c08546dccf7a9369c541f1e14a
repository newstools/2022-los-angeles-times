Rabbit was something that could be fairly easily hunted by enslaved people to offset their meager daily rations. It might be my favorite protein. It’s got similar characteristics to chicken and can be prepared using a lot of the same techniques. In this recipe, we first brine, then marinate the rabbit legs to infuse them with  extra flavor  and to keep the lean meat juicy. If you can’t find rabbit, you can easily substitute  with chicken legs.

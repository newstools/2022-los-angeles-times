Coachella has set dates to return to the Empire Polo Club in 2023. The country’s premiere music festival, now fully back in action after two years away during the pandemic, will return April 14 through16 and 21 through 23. The pre-sale for tickets goes live Friday, June 17, at 10 a.m. PT. Frank Ocean, who was set to headline back in 2020, is the only confirmed act for the bill next year. Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and Swedish House Mafia with the Weeknd headlined the 2022 festival. The final lineup came after Travis Scott was dropped following the Astroworld tragedy, and Kanye West was quickly added as his replacement and then just as quickly canceled. Scott will headline promoter Goldenvoice’s Day N Vegas festival this September. Goldenvoice is the promoter of Coachella and its sister country-music festival, Stagecoach. This year’s Coachella attracted 125,000 fans per day to Indio and drew some consternation from fans and locals after the festival reneged on its COVID-19 mitigation policies.

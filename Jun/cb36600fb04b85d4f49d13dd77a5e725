A growing brush fire outside Napa, Calif., prompted evacuations and grew to 570 acres by Tuesday night, state fire officials said. The Old fire, which broke out around 3:35 p.m., was 5% contained around 9 p.m., according to an update by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Evacuations were initially ordered from 1300 Old Soda Springs Road to the end of the road, then were extended to include all of Soda Canyon Road, Cal Fire officials said. “This is a mandatory evacuation due to a fire,” the Napa County Sheriff’s Office said. “Please leave the area.” By Tuesday night, Cal Fire officials said that the blaze was much less active than earlier and that firefighters would work through the night to contain and control the fire. The Napa Community Animal Response Team was activated in response to the fire. A livestock animal shelter opened at the Valley Brook Equestrian Center, 1132 El Centro Ave., according to the organization. Those in need of livestock animal shelter services were asked to call (707) 732-1555 before arriving. Email requests for animal services can be sent to info@napacart.org.

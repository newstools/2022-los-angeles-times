The shooting occurred on the perimeter in front of the campus, said Los Angeles School Police Chief Leslie Ramirez. It was “believed to be gang-related,” according to a tweet from the LAPD. A male student was shot and is being treated for his injuries, Ramirez said. He was stable at the time he was transported to a hospital. Officers from the LAPD and the L.A.

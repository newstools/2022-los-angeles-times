A California Highway Patrol officer was shot while making a traffic stop in Studio City on Monday night, according to authorities. The shooting occurred around 7:55 p.m. in the 4500 block of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, said Officer Luis Garcia, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson. The officer was shot while conducting a traffic stop, CHP Officer Moises Marroquin said. Nicholas Prange, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson, confirmed the officer was taken to a hospital in critical condition. An update on the officer’s condition was not available Monday night. Authorities are searching for a Ford Fusion that fled the scene on Laurel Canyon, a law enforcement  source told The Times. Garcia said later Monday that the CHP had taken over the investigation and referred further questions to that agency. The Times could not reach a CHP spokesperson for further comment or updates Monday night. A law enforcement source told The Times that LAPD SWAT units were at an apartment complex in the 7400 block of Haskell Avenue in Van Nuys, where they conducted an extensive search. Officers found a vehicle they believe is connected to the shooting, and a large LAPD presence was in the area late Monday as authorities continued to search for the gunman, the source said. Investigators believe they know the shooter’s identity, the source said.  According to KCBS-TV Channel 2, police went to the apartment complex after they received a license plate number from the vehicle the injured officer had pulled over.  The officers found a white Ford Fusion that matched the description of the suspect’s vehicle after they arrived at the complex, the news station reported. Believing the suspect was barricaded inside, the officers made an entry plan but found only the suspect’s roommate after they entered, KCBS reported. The roommate was detained for questioning. As of late Monday night, it was not known whether the suspect was in custody, according to the station.

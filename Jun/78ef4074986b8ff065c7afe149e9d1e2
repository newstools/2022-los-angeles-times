An American woman is set to plead guilty Tuesday to leading an all-female battalion of Islamic State militants in Syria, court records show. A plea hearing for Allison Fluke-Ekren is scheduled to take place in federal court in Alexandria, Va., according to a court notation. Her lawyer did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Fluke-Ekren, who once lived in Kansas, was brought to the U.S. in January to face a criminal charge of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. She moved to Egypt in 2008 and, according to prosecutors, in 2016 began leading an all-female Islamic State unit in the Syrian city of Raqqa that was trained in the use of AK-47 rifles, grenades and suicide belts. A detention memo filed by 1st  Asst. U.S. Atty. Raj Parekh says she trained children how to use assault rifles, and at least one witness saw one of her children — about 6 or 7 years old — holding a machine gun in the family’s home in Syria.  Prosecutors have also said that Fluke-Ekren wanted to recruit operatives to attack a college campus in the U.S. and discussed a terrorist attack on a shopping mall. She told one witness that “she considered any attack that did not kill a large number of individuals to be a waste of resources,” according to an FBI affidavit. A criminal complaint against Fluke-Ekren was filed under seal in 2019 but not made public until she was brought back to the U.S. to face charges.

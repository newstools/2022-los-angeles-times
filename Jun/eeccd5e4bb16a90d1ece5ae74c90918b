A brush fire that broke out Thursday afternoon threatened homes in Sylmar before officials got it under control. More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze — which appeared to be burning in a mostly vacant field that was surrounded by homes — over the course of about 90 minutes. The fire was reported around 2 p.m. in the 15200 block of West Lakeside Street, fire officials said. Its spread was stopped at around 25 acres by 3:35 p.m., the Los Angeles Fire Department said. “Firefighters assigned to structure protection defended homes on several sides of the fire, while air and ground crews made direct attacks on the flames to snuff out this fire in one hour and 40 minutes,” the department said. No injuries or damaged structures were reported. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. Video from KABC-TV Channel 7 showed the fire burning in dry brush feet away from a home before it was contained.

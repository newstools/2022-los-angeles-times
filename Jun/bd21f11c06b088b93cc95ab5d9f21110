An incumbent councilman is facing a challenge from a college administrator in South Los Angeles’ District 9, which was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and has struggled with homelessness, crime and gentrification issues.  The district stretches from the southern tip of downtown L.A., through USC and Exposition Park and deep into South Los Angeles. These are the latest fundraising numbers from the L.A. Ethics Commission. The race Vasquez has been critical of Price’s record, saying in her campaign mail that he let crime and homelessness get out of control. She also chided him for approving three huge digital billboards backed by his campaign supporters on Washington Boulevard. Price has touted his success in increasing the city’s minimum wage, building low-income housing and creating a guaranteed income pilot program to help the city’s neediest. His campaign has also issued a series of lacerating attacks against his opponent, many of them built around Vasquez’s comparatively recent arrival in the district — and her voting history.

A Los Angeles police officer was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of forgery in connection with a scheme to obtain  medical benefits under workers’ compensation, authorities said. Crystal Lara, a 12–year LAPD veteran, was arrested in Los Angeles after an internal investigation, the department said. Lara was taken into custody by the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Division after an investigation that focused on the alleged alteration of doctors’ notes she submitted in August 2020  for medical benefits. An arrest warrant was issued after the L.A. County district attorney’s office filed a charge of forgery against Lara. Lara was booked  and released after posting $20,000 bail. After her arrest, she was relieved of her police powers. The  Internal Affairs Division regularly investigates fraud and abuse of benefits allegations connected with workers’ compensation claims.

Ethan Gourson and Carson Yates hit home runs, catcher Darius Perry went four for four, and UCLA steamrolled Southeastern Louisiana 16-2 in an elimination game of the Auburn Regional on Saturday. UCLA (39-23) will play another elimination game Sunday morning against the loser of Saturday’s nightcap between No. 14 overall seed Auburn and Florida State. Gourson had an RBI double to spark a three-run first inning, and Perry’s two-run single came in the middle of a four-run fourth that gave the Bruins a 7-1 lead. Yates hit a two-run homer in a three-run sixth, and Gourson hit a solo shot in the ninth to cap the scoring. UCLA scored multiple runs in five innings. Ethan Flanagan went four innings in a start for the Bruins, giving up an unearned run, two hits and three walks. Jake Saum (4-0) relieved Flanagan and picked up the victory with a scoreless inning of work. Tyler Finke had a double as the Lions (30-31) managed just three hits.

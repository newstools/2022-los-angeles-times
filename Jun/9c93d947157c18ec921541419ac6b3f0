If you cover high school sports long enough no matter where you live in America, there’s a good chance at least one athlete will make it to the professional ranks. The exception is Southern California, where there are so many future stars living among us that you can visit a T-ball field, swimming pool, gymnasium, park, beach, golf course or soccer field to find a singular talent. It’s no wonder predictions of greatness start at age 5, gather momentum at 10, pick up steam at 13, then the surreal life sets in dealing with college recruiters, picking a high school, picking a private coach, learning about rankings and planning for the future. As the 2021-22 high school sports season comes to an end, fans in Southern California are fortunate because there is no drought in talent. The trajectory continues to be endless. COVID-19 presented unprecedented challenges. Some families left California but many stayed while others could be coming back. Let’s take a peek at what 2022-23 has in store in terms of whom we get to watch:  There are many more athletes to be seen in water polo, volleyball, golf and lacrosse. Enjoy your summer break, because the next school year has the chance to be entertaining and enlightening.

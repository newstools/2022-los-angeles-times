Firefighters are beginning to gain control over a brush fire in Solano County that prompted a dire evacuation order Wednesday afternoon. The Wintu fire grew to about 110 acres and was 65% contained as of early Wednesday night, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “Air resources have been released from the incident,” according to Cal Fire. “Crews will be working on containment and full extinguishment for the next several hours.” Around 6 p.m., the Solano County Office of Emergency Services downgraded  evacuation orders to warnings for residents on Wintu Way and Campos Lane. The warnings were canceled later Wednesday night, according to the agency. Further information, including updated acreage and containment figures, was not  available.

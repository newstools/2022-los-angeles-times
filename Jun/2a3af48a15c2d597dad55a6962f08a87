Seven candidates are vying to be Los Angeles city attorney, a job now held by Mike Feuer. Unless a candidate gets more than 50% of the vote in Tuesday’s primary, the top two contenders head to a runoff in November.  Here are the latest totals from the L.A. Ethics Commission. The position has wide duties, according to the city: “As the City’s general counsel, the City Attorney provides advice and opinions on matters of municipal concern, examines contracts and ordinances as to form and legality, and is frequently called upon to interpret the City Charter, federal and state statutes, and other laws that govern Los Angeles.” As the city’s chief prosecutor, the city attorney prosecutes misdemeanor criminal offenses and infractions, working closely with local law enforcement. The office also administers crime prevention programs focused on preserving neighborhoods’ quality of life and litigates civil actions on behalf of the city in court. The race has a  wide field and no incumbent, with Feuer stepping down after nine years. One key topic in the race is the city attorney’s office handling of the DWP scandal and what various candidates would do about  cleaning that up. Housing, homelessness and crime have come up as issues. So have the pasts of two of the candidates — James, a former public works commissioner, and Gill, a civil rights lawyer. Both men ran for office at one point as Republicans, and both say their views have evolved since then.

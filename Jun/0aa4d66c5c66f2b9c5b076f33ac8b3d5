Malik Monk will sign a two-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, sources informed of the deal unauthorized to speak about it publicly told The Times. The contract is expected to be worth nearly $20 million, more than the Lakers could’ve offered under salary-cap rules. Monk, 24, rejuvenated his career last season with the Lakers, averaging 13.8 points and making 39.1% of his three-pointers. A former first-round pick of the Charlotte Hornets, the Lakers signed Monk on a one-year minimum deal last season. The team could only re-sign him using an exception worth around $6 million per season. Another potential Lakers target, Mo Bamba, agreed to a deal to remain with the Orlando Magic. Monk started 37 games for the Lakers last season and recorded career highs nearly across the board statistically. NBA free agency opened Thursday at 3 p.m. PDT.

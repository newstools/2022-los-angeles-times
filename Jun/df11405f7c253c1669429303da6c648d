Firefighters have stopped the progress of a brush fire that broke out Monday night in the Hollywood Hills near an apartment complex in the area of Universal Studios. The Coyote fire burned about 1 acre of “medium to heavy brush” above a dog park near the AVA Toluca Hills apartment complex off Barham Boulevard, the Los Angeles Fire Department said around 11 p.m. It took 100 firefighters, assisted by helicopter water drops, 75 minutes to gain control of the blaze, authorities said. “Ground crews will continue to work with [Los Angeles County Fire Department] hand crews into the early morning hours with hand tools to achieve further control of the fire’s perimeter in rugged terrain,” the LAFD said. No injuries or structure damage were reported, firefighters said. No evacuations were ordered. The fire did not threaten the apartment complex, Universal City, Universal Studios, the Hollywood sign or any other nearby landmarks or areas, firefighters said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, according to the LAFD.

Angel City FC didn’t score in Saturday night’s NWSL match at Banc of California Stadium, but an own goal by the Kansas City Current was the difference in a 1-0 victory for the hosts. In the 70th minute, Christen Press, after taking a through ball from Savannah McCaskill, sent a pass through the goal box that was knocked in by Current defender Taylor Leach. Goalkeeper DiDi Haracic made a quality save — her lone save — for Angel City(3-1-0) early in the game when she stopped a free kick by Alexis Loera that was headed for the upper left corner in the ninth minute.

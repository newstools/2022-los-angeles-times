A gunman killed 21 people, including 19 children, in a shooting Tuesday at an elementary school in a predominantly Latino Texas town. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference that the shooter — whom he identified as Salvador Ramos, 18 — had a handgun and possibly a rifle Tuesday morning when he entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, a working-class city of about 16,000 people about 80 miles west of San Antonio. Ramos had been a student at a nearby high school, Abbott said. A law enforcement source said a Border Patrol agent who is part of the tactical team near the school fired the shots that killed the gunman.

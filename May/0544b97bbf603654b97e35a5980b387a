Graduation is just around the corner, and as a soon-to-be graduate myself, I know firsthand the time and effort put into earning a professional degree. From the sleepless nights to the endless hours spent on homework, graduation is a time to celebrate hard work and success. One thing to keep in mind is that post-grad life is different for everyone. Whatever route the soon-to-be graduate in your life decides to take, this gift guide has you covered with gifts to support their individual journey. Frankly, school is expensive and time-consuming.  Which is why you won’t go wrong with the classic gift of money. As I approach graduation, let me tell you, cash is indeed king. And Venmo or Zelle is fine! Some grads may even prefer it.

The Buzz is back! Here are our panel of experts’ picks for what the Television Academy probably will consider for Emmys — and what it should. It’s Round 1 of the 2022 Emmys BuzzMeter! Our six veteran TV journalists have stared at their screens until the world no longer made sense just to bring you their analyses of 14 Emmy categories. In Round 1, they list shows and performers they expect to get attention from the academy, as well as others they believe deserve it (collectively, what’s “buzzworthy”). They rank their picks in each category, with the top choice receiving the most points and the bottom receiving the fewest. As the July 12 nominations announcement charges toward us, they’ll make Round 2 predictions for what they think actually will be nominated. After that, they’ll predict the winners in Round 3. Not only can you check out all the BuzzMeter Emmy musings below; you can vote for your favorites in the polls for each week’s featured category. This week, we feature a category with massive turnover expected from last year: outstanding drama series.  The theme among drama contenders seems to be in with the new and out — as in “farewell to” — the old. Six of the BuzzMeter’s 10 highest vote-getters are in their first seasons, with “Euphoria” in its second. Of the three veteran series, two (“Better Call Saul” and “Ozark”) are in their final seasons. Of course, those three include a recent winner (“Succession”) and a five-time nominee (“Saul”). Both “Saul” and “Succession” have been nominated every season they have been on the air. Meanwhile, perhaps this year’s most water-coolery of TV dramas — “Yellowjackets,” “Severance,” SAG-, Critics’ Choice- and Independent Spirit-winning “Squid Game” (Netflix’s most-watched series ever), the completely rethought “Bel-Air” and the lush “Pachinko” — make the initial cut (assuming there are  eight nominees, as in recent years). Panelist Kristen Baldwin, stanning both “Pachinko” and “Squid Game,” says, “Dear Emmy voters: ... The world will not end if you nominate two worthy Korean-language dramas in one year.” Panelist Glenn Whipp sees it as a competition between “Squid Game” and “Succession”: “The race figures to be a nailbiter.” Other notables on the long list include the controversial “Winning Time,” the mind-bending MCU entry “Loki” and the final season of “This Is Us,” with the four-time nominee receiving only three points on three last-place votes by panelists. 1. “Yellowjackets”2. “Severance”3. “Squid Game”4. “Succession”5. “Better Call Saul”6. “Euphoria”7. “Bel-Air”8. “Pachinko”9. “Ozark”10. “The Gilded Age”11. “The Good Fight”12. “Loki”13. (tie) “The Morning Show”13. (tie) “Yellowstone”15. (tie) “Winning Time”15. (tie) “Bridgerton”17. “Slow Horses”18. “This Is Us”    Zendaya, the youngest performer to win in the category, narrowly leads first-round voting over Critics’ Choice Award winner Melanie Lynskey of “Yellowjackets.” One point separates the two. From there, it’s a steep dropoff to the rest of the pack — seven points separate the other six actresses to make the eight-nominee cut, with Juliette Lewis one-half point out of the circle. By the way, that “pack” includes Oscar, Tony and Emmy nominees, a Tony winner and three previous Emmy winners. Panelist Trey Mangum says, “A two-peat for Zendaya seems undeniable at this point,” while Glenn Whipp points out that despite very tough competition, “The Emmys do like reruns.” Meanwhile, Lorraine Ali says Britt Lower “slays in ‘Severance,’ but does she have any memory of her performance?” Notably, Sarah Lancashire of “Julia” received votes as lead actress in both comedy and drama for the show. 1. Zendaya (“Euphoria”)2. Melanie Lynskey (“Yellowjackets”)3. (tie) Aunjanue Ellis (“61st Street”)3. (tie) Britt Lower (“Severance”)5. Christine Baranski (“The Good Fight”)6. Laura Linney (“Ozark”)7. Jodie Comer (“Killing Eve”)8. Carrie Coon (“The Gilded Age”)9. Juliette Lewis (“Yellowjackets”)10. Tawny Cypress (“Yellowjackets”)11. Simone Ashley (“Bridgerton”)12. Jennifer Aniston (“The Morning Show”)13. Sarah Lancashire (“Julia”)14. Elisabeth Moss (“Shining Girls”)15. Sandra Oh (“Killing Eve”)16. (tie) Cassandra Freeman (“Bel-Air”)16. (tie) Julia Roberts (“Gaslit”)   Votes were all over the place for the leading men, with the top three — Adam Scott, SAG winner Lee Jung-jae and Bob Odenkirk — in a tight race on top. The father-son team from “Succession,” including previous winner Jeremy Strong, follows, very close to each other in the voting. Tom Hiddleston bids for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first nod in the category, while previous winner Sterling K. Brown should get some attention for his show’s final season and the new dramatic spin on the character Will Smith — played by Jabari Banks — gets love from panelists who think “Bel-Air” slaps. Panelist Tracy Brown says, “Newcomer Jabari Banks and new-to-American-audiences Lee Jung-jae — who has already collected a SAG Award and an Indie Spirit Award for this role — need to be recognized along with the category’s familiar faces.” Matt Roush thinks it’s possible: “The star of ‘Squid Game’ could upset the Emmy cart as he has at other awards shows, but the competition is stiff, with Adam Scott juggling two personas in ‘Severance,’ Bob Odenkirk’s swan song as Saul Goodman and the father-son ‘Succession’ tag team.” Meanwhile, Lorraine Ali isn’t low-key about her appreciation for Hiddleston “for his part in making ‘Loki’ Disney+’s second-best Marvel series behind ‘WandaVision.’ And the horns. Everyone loves those.” 1. Adam Scott (“Severance”)2. Lee Jung-jae (“Squid Game”)3. Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”)4. Brian Cox (“Succession”)5. Jeremy Strong (“Succession”)6. Jabari Banks (“Bel-Air”)7. Tom Hiddleston (“Loki”)8. Sterling K. Brown (“This Is Us”)9. Jason Bateman (“Ozark”)10. Courtney B. Vance (“61st Street”)11. Lee Min-Ho (“Pachinko”)12. Jonathan Bailey (“Bridgerton”)13. Kevin Costner (“Yellowstone”)14. Gary Oldman (“Slow Horses”)15. John C. Reilly (“Winning Time”)16. Patrick Stewart (“Star Trek: Picard”)17. Josh Brolin (“Outer Range”)   Our panelists place not one but two Korean performers on the list, with “Squid Game’s” Jung Ho-yeon, who won the SAG Award for her performance, at the top and Oscar winner Yuh-Jung Youn just making the field of eight for “Pachinko.” There are some strong feelings on the panel. Trey Mangum calls Sydney Sweeney’s “Euphoria” performance a “tour-de-force supporting turn.” Lorraine Ali offered, “Four words — or maybe two names and a show title: Christina Ricci. Misty. ‘Yellowjackets.’ Ricci’s terrifyingly cheery and murderous nerd in the Showtime drama gathered a cult following” — ahem, perhaps appropriately for the show. But one actress got the most impassioned endorsements from the panel: Rhea Seehorn of “Better Call Saul.” Glenn Whipp says, “If Seehorn doesn’t finally earn a nomination for her deft work ... the Emmys should just go dark for a year.” Kristen Baldwin says, “OK, voting body, this is your last chance. Are you going to recognize Rhea Seehorn’s extraordinary work ... or are we going to have to send Gus Fring after you?” I’d pay heed, Television Academy. Gustavo Fring is not a man to be trifled with. 1. Jung Ho-yeon (“Squid Game”)2. (tie) Rhea Seehorn (“Better Call Saul”)2. (tie) Patricia Arquette (“Severance”)4. Christina Ricci (“Yellowjackets”)5. Sydney Sweeney (“Euphoria”)6. Sarah Snook (“Succession”)7. Julia Garner (“Ozark”)8. Yuh-Jung Youn (“Pachinko”)9. Cassandra Freeman (“Bel-Air”)10. Nicola Coughlan (“Bridgerton”)11. Sally Field (“Winning Time”)12. Isabel May (“1883")13. J. Smith-Cameron (“Succession”)14. Susan Kelechi Watson (“This Is Us”)15. Lili Taylor (“Outer Range”)16. Faith Hill (“1883")    John Turturro (who, let’s be honest, probably should have won as the struggling, sympathetic lawyer in “The Night of”) leads Round 1 as the uptight company man who turns out to have multiple layers in “Severance.” Panelist Matt Roush says Turturro “could triumph for his unexpectedly tender performance as a lonely worker bee.” Four “Succession” actors receive votes, along with two from “Better Call Saul.” Among other interesting top vote-getters: Jason Clarke for his controversial portrayal of hoops legend Jerry West in “Winning Time” and Olly Sholotan for his complete rethink of Carlton in “Bel-Air.” Viewers had to be jarred, going from the silly dancing version of the sitcom to the bitter kid doing lines of Xanax in his walk-in closet. Panelist Trey Mangum says, “A crop of ‘Succession’ stars will seem like the shoo-in, but Olly Sholotan’s Carlton-gone-bad performance in ‘Bel-Air’ is just too good to not recognize.” Tracy Brown agrees: “I’m ready for the Roys to make way for the Bankses in any category, but especially for Olly Sholotan.” 1. John Turturro (“Severance”)2. Kieran Culkin (“Succession”)3. Olly Sholotan (“Bel-Air”)4. Matthew Macfadyen (“Succession”)5. Billy Crudup (“The Morning Show”)6. O Yeong-su (“Squid Game”)7. Giancarlo Esposito (“Better Call Saul”)8. Jason Clarke (“Winning Time”)9. (tie) Tramell Tillman (“Severance”)9. (tie) Park Hae-soo (“Squid Game”)11. Tosin Cole (“61st Street”)12. Nicholas Braun (“Succession”)13. Jonathan Banks (“Better Call Saul”)14. Alan Ruck (“Succession”)15. David Hyde Pierce (“Julia”)16. Owen Wilson (“Loki”)   Surprise, surprise — a network show leads the comedy pack! ABC’s “Abbott Elementary” is well out in front in early voting; it’s one of only two shows to appear on every ballot in Round 1 (“Hacks” being the other). No network show has won in this category since “Modern Family’s” run of dominance ended in 2014. In fact, in the last four years, only two network shows (“The Good Place” and “black-ish”) have even been nominated, accounting for only four of the 31 total nods during that time. Many panelists singled out the ABC show in their comments, with Trey Mangum saying, “‘Abbott Elementary’ changed the broadcast TV comedy. Give it everything.” Kristen Baldwin is down for a shake-up: “This is a packed category that’s bound to be cluttered up by some knee-jerk nominations (*cough* ‘Mrs. Maisel’ *cough*), so it’s on ‘experts’ like us to scream the praises of potentially overlooked gems including ‘Reservation Dogs,’ ‘Abbott Elementary’ and ‘The Other Two.’” Among the notables receiving major support: the returns of “Atlanta” and “Barry,” outstanding debut seasons for “Only Murders in the Building,” “Julia” and “Reservation Dogs,” the latter second only to “Abbott Elementary” among new shows. 1. “Abbott Elementary”2. “Hacks”3. “Reservation Dogs”4. “Atlanta”5. “Barry”6. “Only Murders in the Building”7. “Ted Lasso”8. “Julia”9. “Better Things”10. “The Other Two”11. “Our Flag Means Death”12. (tie) “The Flight Attendant”12. (tie) “Girls5eva”14. “We Are Lady Parts”15. “Ghosts”16. (tie) “The Afterparty”16. (tie) “Insecure”16. (tie) “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”19. (tie) “Cobra Kai”19.

Remember, these moments had to take place in Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers lost two of three to the Pirates in Pittsburgh. They looked tired in Wednesday’s 5-3 loss, of course, if I had to get up at the equivalent of 9:30 a.m. to play baseball I’d look tired too. Nothing to panic about. The same concerns from a week ago are still there (Max Muncy and Justin Turner hitting below .200), and now that they are in a stretch of 31 games in 31 days, the big worry will be how the pitching looks at the end of this long stretch of games. If the Dodgers can come out of this without having to seriously overwork their bullpen, everything will be fine. Ryan Pepiot made his debut Wednesday, and looked like a pitcher making his major league debut. He gave up only one hit in three innings, but walked five and hit a batter. He’s going to be fine. Remember, Walker Buehler had an ERA of 7.71 in his first eight games with the Dodgers, and Clayton Kershaw walked a ton of guys (4.6 per 9 IP) his first two seasons with the team. Pepiot is going to be a good pitcher for a long time. With the loss, the Dodgers are 12-4 against teams with a losing record this season. That’s pretty good. Don’t obsess over two losses to the Pirates and look at the overall picture. The Dodgers have not played their best baseball consistently this season and still have one of the best records in baseball.

Six people who were trapped inside a Temple City strip mall when a portion of the building’s facade collapsed Wednesday afternoon have been freed, according to authorities. The incident occurred in the 9000 block of East Las Tunas Drive, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Two addresses were affected by the collapse: 9449 ½ and 9451 E. Las Tunas Drive, said Sgt. Ed Luna, a watch commander at the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department’s Temple Station. A search for those addresses showed they belong to a hair salon and dry cleaning shop. Deputies were first called to the scene shortly after 4 p.m., Luna said. None of the people were injured and all six were freed, firefighters said in an update just after 5:30 p.m.

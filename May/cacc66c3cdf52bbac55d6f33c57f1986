The ocean was two things once,  in two places, north it was the high icy waves of Bodega Bay, Dillon, and Limantour,  and south it was the blue ease of Oceanside and Encinitas, umbrellas  in a sleepy breeze. It took me years to realize, those two blues  were the same ocean. I thought they must be separate. Must  be cleaved in the center by a fault line. On a call just now with my grandmother  she mentions how all the flowers I’ve sent are from my garden, so I let her  believe it. Sweet lies of the mind. She says she’s surprised  I like to grow things, didn’t think I was that kind of girl, she always thought I was  a runaway child. She flicks her hand away, to show me  her hand becoming a bird, swerving until it is a white gull in the wind. She repeats  a runaway child. Mercy is not frozen in time, but flits  about frantically unsure where to land. As children, they’d bring us to the ocean,  divorce distraction and summer, we’d drift with the tide southward until   we’d almost lose sight of them, waving dramatically for our return,  shouting until we came back to shore. Once, when she was watching us  I tried to run away, four or five, and when I got to the end of the driveway  she didn’t try to stop me. Even shut the door. And so I came back. She knew what it was  to be unloved, abandoned by her mother, riding her bike by her father’s house  with his other children, late afternoons, before her grandmother would call  her home for supper. Some days, I think she would have let me leave, some days  I think of her shaking on the shore. Now, she thinks all the flowers I’ve sent,  are from my garden. Grown from seeds and tended. She gets a kick  out of it, this runaway child so overly loved, she could dare to drift  away from it all.

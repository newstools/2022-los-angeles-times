House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, was arrested late Saturday in Napa County  on charges of driving under the influence. Pelosi was arrested at 11:44 p.m. Saturday and booked shortly after 4 a.m. Sunday, according to Napa County’s booking report. His bail was set at $5,000. The arrest was first reported by TMZ. Authorities at the Napa County Sheriff’s Department did not respond immediately to requests for further information. Nancy Pelosi’s office, in an email statement Sunday, said that “the Speaker will not be commenting on this private matter which occurred while she was on the East Coast.” In a tweet Sunday morning, Pelosi shared that she was at Brown University delivering the commencement oration and receiving an honorary doctorate degree. Nancy and Paul Pelosi have been married since 1963. An investor and developer based in San Francisco, Pelosi reflected in an interview in 2009 that it has always been a careful dance of balancing his business life with  his wife’s political career. People are always trying to link the two of them, he said, joking that only at his alma mater, Georgetown, where he serves on the Foreign Service Board, is he not known as “Mr. Nancy.”

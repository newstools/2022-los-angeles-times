Authorities are  battling a brush fire that started in rural Colusa County north of Sacramento on Tuesday. Law enforcement officials were notifying residents  but had not called for evacuations, according to the Colusa County sheriff’s office. Wind direction in the area was unpredictable, and authorities  activated an emergency operations center, according to the sheriff’s office. As of about 6:30 p.m., the fire had scorched 600 acres and was 50% contained, the sheriff’s office said. Colusa city officials asked the community to avoid Colusa Levee Scenic Park, the Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area and Main Street, on the north end of town. “We also ask that you do not travel north out of town on [Highway] 45/Princeton Road or River Road, unless absolutely necessary, so all responding agencies have a safe environment to work without interference,” officials said in an alert posted to Facebook. The public was advised to bring pets inside, avoid the outdoors and close any open windows.

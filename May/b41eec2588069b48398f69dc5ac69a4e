Los Angeles firefighters got control of a fast-growing brush fire that broke out Thursday night in San Pedro in a park near homes, according to authorities. Ground and air teams were called to a 1-acre blaze that started amid medium grass and brush in rugged terrain at Peck Park, 560 North Western Ave., according to a 6:15 p.m. alert by the Los Angeles Fire Department. The park abuts homes and a shopping center. Helicopter footage from KTLA-TV Channel 5 showed flames and billowing smoke  close to homes. None appeared to be on fire. Authorities called a greater alarm and more crews arrived to help battle the fire, officials said. In all, 81 firefighters were sent to the scene. The fire grew to 10 acres by the time crews brought the blaze under control, firefighters said in a 7:45 p.m. update. “Precise LAFD helicopter water drops helped stop forward progress of the fire,” the officials said. “With 81 LAFD personnel assigned, the firefight will continue hand tools and hose lines against stubborn residual flames.” No injuries, need for evacuation or structure damage were reported, firefighters said. Ground crews were anticipated to stay on-site to mop up the fire through the night. Further information was not available Thursday.

Alexander Skarsgard, the Swedish actor who starred in “True Blood” and the recent film “The Northman,” is shopping around his Manhattan penthouse of five years for $2.6 million. That’s $300,000 more than he paid for the unit in 2017, but the price bump comes with some upgrades. Skarsgard fixed the place up during his half-decade stay, remodeling the kitchen and touching up the walls and warm pine floors. Found in the East Village, the prewar home is tucked atop a townhouse built in 1845. It’s part of a co-op, and the $2,222 monthly HOA dues pay for maintenance, a live-in superintendent and common garden. The home shows its age in a good way with a stone fireplace, exposed brick walls and rustic beamed ceilings broken up by five skylights. Modern finishes include marble in the kitchen, motorized shades in the bedroom and a custom wall of brass in the bathroom. The floor plan currently holds one bedroom, but the listing claims a second can be added. It also comes with roof rights, so the buyer could build a private rooftop deck overlooking the New York City skyline. Emma St. Laurent and Stephane Guerrier of Compass hold the listing. A native of Stockholm, Skarsgard served in the Swedish military before moving to the U.S. for acting. He rose to fame with a role in 2001’s “Zoolander,” and his more recent credits include “The Legend of Tarzan” and the TV shows “Big Little Lies” and “Succession.”

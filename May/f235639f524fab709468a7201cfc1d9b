Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news. From Helene Elliott: The symbolism seemed obvious when Kings coach Todd McLellan chose Cal Petersen over Jonathan Quick as the starting goaltender for the team’s season opener in October.  The decision created images of a torch being passed from the ring-adorned hands of the core group that won two Stanley Cup championships to the skilled but largely unproven hands of the kids entrusted with ending the franchise’s post-Cup decline. Quick had earned nearly every significant goaltending record in franchise history over his 14 seasons and had started every regular-season opener since 2009, but there was no room for nostalgia when fans and players needed a playoff berth to sustain their faith in a long rebuilding process. Besides, the calendar doesn’t lie: He was 35 when the season began and had undergone shoulder surgery five months earlier after playing only 22 games in the pandemic-shortened 2020-21 season. It seemed time for Quick, Anze Kopitar, Dustin Brown and Drew Doughty — the remaining players from the Kings’ 2012 and 2014 Cup teams — to begin receding into the background while the next generation rose to the top of the depth chart. It was a sensible plan until Quick shredded it by rekindling his old ferocity and displaying the legendary flexibility of his younger days to win back the No. 1 job. Challenged to withstand the team’s wave of injuries, the missteps of a young defense, and the pressure of frequent one-goal games, Quick produced gutsy performances when the Kings’ postseason chances were iffy. He didn’t start their first regular-season game, but he will start their first playoff game since 2018 when they face the high-powered Oilers on Monday at Rogers Place in Edmonton. The torch remains in his gloved hands. “You can tell he’s a winner — his attitude on the ice, off the ice. He’s always working really hard,” center Phillip Danault said. “He’s always focused and ready to go for the boys. Every game he’s giving us a chance this year and he’s doing it again. Quickie’s been awesome for us, and hopefully it will be the same in the playoffs.”  NHL playoffs, schedule and resultsAll times PacificFirst roundWestern Conference No. 2 Edmonton vs. No. 3 KingsTonight, at Edmonton, 7 p.m., ESPN2Wednesday, at Edmonton, 7 p.m., ESPN2Friday, at Kings, 7 p.m., TBSSunday, at Kings, 7 p.m., TBS*Tuesday, May 10, at Edmonton, TBD*Thursday, May 12, at Kings, TBD*Saturday, May 14, at Edmonton, TBD No. 1 Colorado vs. WC#2 NashvilleTuesday at Colorado, 6:30 p.m., ESPNThursday at Colorado, 6:30 p.m., TNTSaturday at Nashville, 1:30 p.m., TNTMonday, May 9, at Nashville, 6:30 p.m., ESPN*Wednesday, May 11, at Colorado, TBD*Friday, May 13, at Nashville, TBD*Sunday, May 15, at Colorado, TBD No. 2 Minnesota vs. No. 3 St. LouisTonight at Minnesota, 6:30 p.m., ESPNWednesday at Minnesota, 6:30 p.m., ESPNFriday, at St. Louis, 6:30 p.m., TNTSunday, at St. Louis, 1:30 p.m., TBS*Tuesday, May 10, at Minnesota, TBD*Thursday, May 12, at St. Louis, TBD*Saturday, May 14, at Minnesota, TBD No. 1 Calgary vs. WC#1 DallasTuesday at Calgary, 7 p.m., ESPN2Thursday at Calgary, 7 p.m., TBSSaturday at Dallas, 6:30 p.m., TNTMonday, May 9, at Dallas, 6:30 p.m., TBS*Wednesday, May 11, at Calgary, TBD*Friday, May 13, at Dallas, TBD*Sunday, May 15, at Calgary, TBD Eastern Conference No. 1 Florida vs. WC#2 WashingtonTuesday at Florida, 4:30 p.m., ESPN2Thursday at Florida, 4:30 p.m., TBSSaturday at Washington, 10 a.m., ESPNMonday, May 9, at Washington, 4 p.m., TBS*Wednesday, May 11, at Florida, TBD*Friday, May 13, at Washington, TBD*Sunday, May 15, at Florida, TBD No. 2 Toronto vs. No. 3 Tampa BayTonight at Toronto, 4:30 p.m., ESPN2Wednesday at Toronto, 4:30 p.m., ESPN2Friday, at Tampa Bay, 4:30 p.m., TBSSunday, at Tampa Bay, 4 p.m., TBS*Tuesday, May 10, at Toronto, TBD*Thursday, May 12, at Tampa Bay, TBD*Saturday, May 14, at Toronto, TBD No. 1 Carolina at WC#1 BostonTonight at Carolina, 4 p.m., ESPNWednesday at Carolina, 4 p.m., ESPNFriday, at Boston, 4 p.m., TNTSunday, at Boston, 9:30 a.m., ESPN*Tuesday, May 10, at Carolina, TBD*Thursday, May 12, at Boston, TBD*Saturday, May 14, at Carolina, TBD No. 2 New York Rangers vs. No. 3 Pittsburgh PenguinsTuesday at New York, 4 p.m., ESPNThursday at New York, 4 p.m., TNTSaturday at Pittsburgh, 4 p.m., TNTMonday, May 9, at Pittsburgh, 4 p.m., ESPN*Wednesday, May 11, at New York, TBD*Friday, May 13, at Pittsburgh, TBD*Sunday, May 15, at New York, TBD *-if necessary From Jack Harris: The role of an ace comes with myriad responsibilities. Opening day starts. Playoff outings. And, over the course of a season, the need to occasionally serve as a stopper for a pitching staff, putting an end to rough patches in a campaign before they become full-blown slumps. That’s what Walker Buehler did for the Dodgers on Sunday. With his team coming off three losses in its previous four games, Buehler wasn’t dominant against the Detroit Tigers. He gave up six hits. He dealt with traffic all day. He retired the side in order only once. But he got the results he — and the team — needed anyway, pitching five scoreless innings to help the Dodgers win 6-3 and take two of three games against the Tigers this weekend at Dodger Stadium. “It was a grind, they got the pitch count up, but he found a way to get through five innings,” manager Dave Roberts said. “That’s what top-end guys do.” There were other contributors to Sunday’s victory. Freddie Freeman had two hits and an RBI. Trea Turner, Will Smith and Cody Bellinger also picked up RBIs. The Tigers committed a couple errors, too, leading to two unearned runs. But Buehler was the biggest factor, following up his first major league shutout against the Arizona Diamondbacks last Monday by recording consecutive scoreless starts for only the fourth time in his career.  Mike Trout homered, doubled and scored three runs, Michael Lorenzen pitched into the ninth inning and the Angels held off the Chicago White Sox 6-5 Sunday for their seventh win in eight games. Shohei Ohtani had an RBI as the Angels’ designated hitter. The two-way AL MVP went 0 for 3 and exited in the ninth inning because of tightness in his right groin. Manager Joe Maddon said Ohtani might have tweaked his groin running to first in the seventh inning on a grounder back to pitcher Jose Ruiz that the White Sox turned into a double play. Trout walked in three other plate appearances. Andrew Velazquez and Jo Adell each doubled in a run and Anthony Rendon each had an RBI as the Angels took a 6-0 lead. Despite batting .344 — and a major-league leading 1.247 OPS — Trout says he’s still not completely comfortable at the plate yet. “Some pitches I’m feeling good and some pitches I don’t,” Trout said. “Today, I felt pretty good out there.”  Ryan Hollingshead broke a scoreless tie with a goal in the 82nd minute, José Cifuentes scored in the final minute of full time and LAFC regained the top spot in the Western Conference with a 2-0 victory over Minnesota United in MLS play on Sunday night. LAFC (7-1-1) moved two points ahead of second-place Austin FC with the win. LAFC has scored multiple goals in six of its seven victories this season. Danny Musovski notched an assist on Hollingshead’s game-winner. Diego Palacios and Francisco Ginella had assists on Cifuentes’ insurance score. LAFC outshot Minnesota United (4-3-2) 22-6 with a 6-1 advantage in shots on goal. Marina Alex won the Palos Verdes Championship on Sunday for her second LPGA Tour title, breaking a tie with a two-putt birdie on the par-five 16th and parring the final two holes for a one-stroke victory over Jin Young Ko. Three strokes behind Hannah Green entering the round, Alex closed with a five-under 66 to finish at 10-under 274 at hilly and windy Palos Verdes Golf Club. “The hard work has paid off,” said Alex, the 31-year-old from New Jersey who recently fought a herniated disk in her lower back. “I wasn’t sure if this would ever happen again if I’m being perfectly honest. It’s been tough. We’re all getting older. I’m getting older. There are so many amazing players out here. The competition is really, really difficult. “So, I just didn’t know if my mind and body were going to put me back in a position that I was going to be able to do it again. Today was the day.” NBA PLAYOFFSSchedule and resultsAll times PacificConference semifinalsWestern Conference No. 1 Phoenix Suns vs. No. 4 Dallas MavericksTonight, at Phoenix, 7 p.m., TNTWednesday, at Phoenix, 7 p.m., TNTFriday, at Dallas, 6:30 p.m., ESPNSunday, at Dallas, 12:30 p.m., ESPN*Tuesday, May 10 at Phoenix, TBD, TBT*Thursday, May 12, TBD, ESPN*Sunday, May 15, TBD No. 2 Memphis Grizzlies vs. No. 3 Golden State WarriorsGolden State 117, Memphis 116Tuesday, at Memphis, 6:30 p.m., TNTSaturday, at Golden State, 5:30 p.m., ABCMonday, May 9, at Golden State, 7 p.m., TNT*Wednesday, May 11, at Memphis, TBD, TNT*Friday, May 13, at Golden State, TBD, ESPN*Monday, May 16, at Memphis, TBD, TNT Eastern Conference No. 1 Miami Heat vs. No. 4 Philadelphia 76ersTonight, at Miami, 4:30 p.m., TNTWednesday, at Miami, 4:30 p.m., TNTFriday, at Philadelphia, 4 p.m., ESPNSunday, at Philadelphia, 5 p.m., TNT*Tuesday, May 10, at Miami, TBD, TNT*Thursday, May 12, at Philadelphia, TBD, ESPN*Sunday, May 15, at Miami, TBD No. 2 Boston Celtics vs. No. 3 Milwaukee BucksMilwaukee 101, Boston 89Tuesday, at Boston, 4 p.m., TNTSaturday, at Milwaukee, 12:30 p.m., ABCMonday, May 9, at Milwaukee, 4:30 p.m., TNT*Wed., May 11, at Boston, TBD, TNT*Friday, May 13, at Milwaukee, TBD, ESPN*Sunday, May 15, at Boston, TBD *-if necessary  1904 — Laska Durnell becomes the first woman to own a Kentucky Derby starter and winner when longshot Elwood wins the 30th Run for the Roses.

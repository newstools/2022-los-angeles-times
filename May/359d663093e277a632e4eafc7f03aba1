Thousands of people took to the streets in the Southland on Saturday as part of a nationwide effort to protect abortion rights in the aftermath of a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion overruling the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision. In L.A., activists demonstrated near City Hall in downtown Los Angeles, joining hundreds of women’s rights rallies across the state and the U.S. Protesters also gathered in Long Beach, Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, Palos Verdes and Santa Ana as well as San Francisco, San Diego, Washington, New York, Chicago and Austin, Texas.

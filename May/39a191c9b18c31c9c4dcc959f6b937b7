California coronavirus case rates have worsened dramatically in certain parts of the state in the past week, according to a Times analysis, with some areas particularly hard hit. In Southern California, weekly coronavirus cases roughly doubled in Riverside and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Central Valley and Silicon Valley. Thus far, hospitals have not reported strain in two of California’s largest population centers, Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area. In a statement to The Times, the California Department of Public Health said that the recent growth in coronavirus-positive hospitalizations has been slower than in past surges. Nonetheless, “a continued increase in cases and hospitalizations may impact the hospital system,” the agency warned.  Here’s an in-depth look at how coronavirus case rates have risen over the past week, according to data that was publicly available as of early Tuesday morning. The state data was released on Friday, and L.A. County’s data was released on Monday. A rate of 100 or more coronavirus cases for every 100,000 residents is considered a high rate of transmission, the worst tier on a four-level scale as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  A week-over-week increase of 100% or more is considered fast, rivaling the pace of increases seen as cases soared during the fall-and-winter Omicron surge. California has gone from 142 cases a week for every 100,000 residents to 231 cases a week for every 100,000 residents, a 63% week-over-week increase. L.A.

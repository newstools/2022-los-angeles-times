Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news. From Bill Shaikin: On Wednesday, within 12 hours of the Anaheim City Council killing the Angel Stadium sale, the city of Long Beach renewed its pitch to attract the Angels. In 2019, before negotiating the now-doomed agreement with Anaheim, the Angels considered the lure of a waterfront ballpark in Long Beach. “If the Angels are interested in continuing those initial discussions, Long Beach would reengage in those discussions and seek direction from the City Council,” a statement issued by the office of the Long Beach city manager said. According to the original proposal, the Long Beach stadium would be built on what is known as the “Elephant Lot,” a 13-acre site where circus elephants used to gather. In 2019, the city and the Angels discussed options for a 55-acre proposal, which would have enabled the team to surround the stadium with some of the same entertainment concepts that had been planned around Angel Stadium. In the process, the Long Beach Arena would have been demolished. At the time, the Long Beach City Council authorized negotiations on a land parcel that would have enveloped the ballpark site and included the city’s convention center, performing arts center, arena and a greenbelt between Shoreline Drive and the Pacific Ocean. The Angels’ current lease in Anaheim expires in 2029, with options to extend their stay there through 2038. The site there is 150 acres, leaving almost three times as much room for development. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Angels owner Arte Moreno and his management company said the team would consider all of its options. Those options could include suing the city of Anaheim to try to enforce the land sale there or to pursue damages, playing out the lease in Anaheim, and considering offers from other cities.  ———— Anaheim City Council votes unanimously to halt the sale of Angel Stadium Q&A: What happens to Angels’ future plans with Angel Stadium? Angels fall to Rangers, 7-2   From Jack Harris: The Dodgers suffered their first shutout in 74 games Wednesday. It wasn’t for a lack of chances late in the game. In each of the final two innings, the Dodgers had runners on first and second with one out — a base hit away both times from erasing a one-run deficit against the Washington Nationals. However, the team came up empty in each situation, sealing a 1-0 defeat at Nationals Park that denied them the chance of a series sweep and squandered an impressive six-inning, one-run start from left-hander Julio Urías. ———— ‘Right is right’: Dodgers manager Dave Roberts calls for action after Texas shooting Juan Soto trade rumors have begun. Where do the Dodgers fit?  From Kevin Baxter: Galaxy coach Greg Vanney remembers a time when his team’s home was a fortress. Lately, however, Dignity Health Sports Park has been about as impenetrable as a bowl of chicken soup. But that all changes when LAFC makes the short drive down the Harbor Freeway. For the Galaxy’s neighborhood rivals, the stadium is nothing short of a house of horrors – as it was again when Wednesday when Kévin Cabral and Javier “Chicharito” Hernández scored goals seven minutes apart early in the second half, starting the Galaxy to a 3-1 win that eliminated LAFC from the U.S. Open Cup. With the win the Galaxy go on to face the Sacramento Republic in the tournament quarterfinals next month. The Galaxy has made it past the U.S. Open quarterfinals just once since 2006.  From Dan Woike: Former Portland head coach Terry Stotts became the first candidate to meet with the Lakers in person Tuesday as the organization ramps up its search to replace Frank Vogel, sources confirmed to the Times. Milwaukee assistant coach Darvin Ham and Golden State assistant Kenny Atkinson also are scheduled to speak with the team in person. All three are considered serious candidates for the coaching vacancy in Charlotte, as well. Stotts, a veteran coach who began his career on the sidelines of the Continental Basketball Assn., led Portland to the Western Conference finals during a stretch of eight straight playoff berths with the Trail Blazers before being replaced by Chauncey Billups after the 2020-21 season.

Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and let’s take a look at the Dodgers’ amazing pitching this season. When real games began, there was concern (including from this very newsletter) about the lack of depth in the starting rotation. And, while the lack of depth is still a problem, the fact is the rotation has been stellar, and when Andrew Heaney went on the IL, Tyler Anderson stepped in and has done very well. The bullpen also has been fantastic, leading to what is a pretty amazing stat. Look at the fewest runs allowed by an NL team this season: Dodgers, 60 (2.31 per game)St. Louis, 97 (3.46)New York, 100 (3.33)Milwaukee, 102 (3.42)Miami, 103 (3.68)San Francisco, 107 (3.82)San Diego, 112 (3.86)Arizona, 112 (3.86)League average: 119 (4.19) In last place is Cincinnati, which has allowed 179 (6.39 per game), which helps explain why the Reds are 5-23. Let’s look at ERA Dodgers, 2.07New York, 3.24Milwaukee, 3.25Miami, 3.32Arizona, 3.33St. Louis, 3.45League average: 3.92 Starting pitcher ERA Dodgers, 1.83Arizona, 2.21New York, 3.05San Diego, 3.08Milwaukee, 3.35Miami, 3.50San Francisco, 3.68St. Louis, 3.72Worst: Cincinnati, 8.54 Reliever ERA  Dodgers, 2.42Miami, 3.05Milwaukee, 3.08St. Louis, 3.11Atlanta, 3.28Chicago, 3.46San Francisco, 3.47New York, 3.53Worst: Cincinnati, 4.92 Those are amazing numbers by the Dodgers, and probably unsustainable. And the Dodgers also lead the league in runs scored per game (5.15). Also, I’m glad I don’t write a Cincinnati Reds newsletter. The worst ERA on the Dodgers this season is the 5.40 by Garrett Cleavinger, who pitched on 1.2 innings and is now in the minors. After that it is 4.50 Mitch White (8 IP, on IL) and 4.09 by Evan Phillips (11 IP). Only one other pitcher (Justin Bruihl, sent to the minors Sunday) has an ERA above 3.00. He cut his hair too short. There, problem solved. Walker Buehler started his 100th game on Sunday, becoming the 68th Dodger, and 35th L.A. Dodger, to start 100 games. Barring injury, he should have around 25 more starts this season, which will move him up the list quickly. The Dodgers he could tie or pass: 47. Hyun-Jin Ryu, 125 starts47. Sherry Smith, 12549. George Bell, 12450. Andy Messersmith, 12351. Curt Davis, 12252. Al Downing, 12052. Tom Lovett, 12052. Odalis Perez, 12055. Tim Belcher, 11956. Jesse Petty, 11857. Dutch Ruether, 11758. Rube Marquard, 11558. Brad Penny, 11560. Kiroki Kuroda, 11461. Darren Dreifort, 11362. Rick Honeycutt, 10863. Roger Craig, 10363. Kenta Maeda, 10365. Hal Gregg, 10166. Walker Buehler, 10066. Dan Daub, 10066. Doug McWeeny, 100 The leader is, of course, Don Sutton, with 533 starts for the Dodgers. COVID-19 IL David Price, LHP. Price will be heading to the Arizona facilities to build up his arm strength and should be back the middle of this month. Mitch White, RHP, has joined triple-A Oklahoma City to build up his arm strength. 10-day IL Victor González, LHP, left elbow inflammation. He is going to have arthroscopic surgery on his elbow this week and his return date depends on what they find. Andrew Heaney, LHP, left shoulder discomfort. He has been cleared to resume throwing. That will lead to eventually pitching off a mound and then a minor-league rehab assignment. If all goes well, he’ll be back in June. Blake Treinen, RHP, right shoulder discomfort. He still has soreness in his shoulder and Dave Roberts said Sunday he probably won’t be back until after the All-Star break. 60-day IL Caleb Ferguson, LHP, Tommy John surgery. Began a rehab assignment with Oklahoma City on April 28 and has a 13.50 ERA after two innings. Could be back this month. His last game with Dodgers was Sept. 15, 2020. Danny Duffy, LHP, left elbow. He is throwing pain free and could be back after the All-Star break. Back being a relative term since he has never actually pitched for the Dodgers. Dustin May, RHP, Tommy John surgery. May is throwing off a mound and has begun to mix in breaking pitches among his fastballs. He is still scheduled to be back in August or September. Jimmy Nelson, RHP, Tommy John surgery. It is extremely unlikely that he pitches for the Dodgers this season.

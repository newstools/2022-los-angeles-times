Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news. From Mike DiGiovanna: Little did Joe Maddon know how prophetic he would sound when the Angels manager was asked before Tuesday night’s game to assess the progress of pitcher Reid Detmers, a 22-year-old left-hander who was occasionally effective but mostly erratic in his first five starts.  “It’s better, but it’s not as good as it can be,” Maddon said. “He’s got great command, good stuff, great makeup, but I don’t think he’s actually executed a game plan with any kind of consistency. So, he’s gonna get better. But to this point, we haven’t seen the best side of him yet.” They did Tuesday night. Detmers, a first-round pick out of Louisville in 2020, threw the 12th no-hitter in franchise history during a 12-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays before an announced crowd of 39,313 in Angel Stadium, striking out only two and walking one during an efficient if not overpowering 108-pitch effort. Mixing a fastball that averaged 92.3 mph and topped out at 93.9 mph with a 72.6-mph curve, 83.6-mph changeup and 82.6-mph slider, Detmers was in control throughout. He took the mound for the ninth with his pitch count at 94. Vidal Brujan popped out to catcher Chad Wallach for the first out and Kevin Kiermaier grounded out to second. Yandy Diaz followed with a grounder to shortstop Andrew Velazquez, who scooped the ball up and fired accurately to first for the final out.  The Angels poured out of their dugout and mobbed Detmers, the pile generating so much momentum it pushed itself from the mound into foul territory down the first-base line. ———— Individual no-hitters by Angels pitchers: Bo Belinsky, May 5, 1962, Baltimore Clyde Wright, July 7, 1970, Oakland Nolan Ryan, May 15, 1973, Kansas City Nolan Ryan, July 15, 1973, Detroit Nolan Ryan, Sept. 28, 1974, Minnesota Nolan Ryan, June 1, 1975, Baltimore Mike Witt*, Sept. 30, 1984, Texas Ervin Santana, July 7, 2011, Cleveland Jered Weaver, May 2, 2012, Minnesota Reid Detmers, May 10, 2022, Tampa Bay *-perfect game———— Angels’ David Fletcher undergoes surgery that will sideline him a couple of months   From Helene Elliott: Adrian Kempe put the Kings in position to advance to the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, driving to the net to score the decisive goal one minute and 12 seconds into overtime and give the Kings a 5-4 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday at a disappointed Rogers Place. The Kings had squandered a two-goal lead late in the third period, but Kempe slid a shot inside the left post on the team’s second shot of sudden-death play to give the Kings a series lead of 3-2. Game 6 will be played on Thursday at Crypto.com Arena, with a seventh game, if necessary, to be played on Saturday in Edmonton. The only consistent factor throughout the first four games of the Kings’ Stanley Cup playoff series against the Oilers was the lack of consistency for both teams from one game to the next. A tense, one-goal victory for the Kings in the opener was followed by a resounding shutout for Edmonton at home in Game 2. The Oilers won by six goals in Game 3 at Los Angeles, though the Kings showed a few signs of life and awakened their dormant power play. They turned those stirrings into their most complete effort in the series and got a 31-save shutout performance by Jonathan Quick in a win Sunday night. The only common thread was the team that scored first won each of those first four games. Both teams have found it impossible to establish momentum, instead finding themselves involved in swings from one tempo and result to the next one. When one coach found a successful bit of strategy, the other coach has found a way to counter it, leaving the teams even at two games each as the series resumed Tuesday night at Rogers Place in Edmonton.

The night before, his team had suffered an uncharacteristic game at the plate. The Dodgers hit plenty of balls hard in their series opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates but mustered only five hits and one run in a rare lopsided loss. Roberts anticipated a response. “Last night was an ugly one,” he said. “I expected to see a different result tonight.” That he did, with the Dodgers putting on an exhibition with the bats to rout the Pirates, 11-1, at PNC Park. The Dodgers recorded a season high in runs and hits, racking up 15. They collected eight doubles, tying the most since relocating to Los Angeles. They also had a triple, a home run and two walks, going eight for 14 with runners in scoring position. “It was a really good offensive night,” Roberts said. “Just good to see guys break out.”  ———— Not only is the All-Star game at Dodger Stadium this year, it is also the 60th anniversary of the opening of Dodger Stadium.

Remember, these moments had to take place in Dodger Stadium. ———— Top Dodgers pitching prospect Ryan Pepiot to make his MLB debut against Pirates From Sam Farmer: If the Rams are playing Denver on Christmas Day — as CBS announced Tuesday morning — that almost certainly means that the defending Super Bowl champions will be squaring off against Buffalo in the Kickoff Game on Sept. 8 at SoFi Stadium. By every indication, the NFL had zeroed in on either the Bills or Broncos playing at the Rams in the traditional Thursday night game that opens the season. The league has not confirmed the Kickoff Game matchup, with the full schedule release coming Thursday night. Buffalo was eliminated from the playoffs last season in an AFC divisional-round overtime thriller at Kansas City. Whenever it takes place, Bills-Rams will feature quarterbacks Matthew Stafford and Buffalo’s Josh Allen, two of the league’s premier passers, and the added wrinkle of new Bills pass rusher Von Miller. He was a key component of the Rams’ Super Bowl run.  From Thuc Nhi Nguyen: Janelle McDonald’s to-do list is growing faster than her list of Twitter followers. Such is life for the new UCLA gymnastics coach. Less than 24 hours after her hire was announced Monday, McDonald began a media gauntlet. The leader of the most popular college gymnastics program in the country sat in person for interviews with The Times and UCLA’s in-house magazine Tuesday and held virtual court via Zoom. Her busy schedule for the rest of the week includes flying to Phoenix for an NCAA gymnastics convention, then stopping at the U.S. Development Program national championships in Mesa, Ariz., for recruiting, returning to the Bay Area to tie up loose ends and then coming back to L.A. to begin a housing hunt. Amid the chaos, McDonald found the most joy during the brief moments she shared with her future athletes. The gymnasts who welcomed her Monday afternoon and brightened up her hectic schedule during an 8 a.m. practice Tuesday are her top priority. “My first step is to get to know the student-athletes really well,” McDonald said. “I want to create a really inclusive environment where everybody feels like somebody, and they know they have a voice here and can be a part of building the culture of the team.” From Bill Plaschke: Jeanie Buss isn’t happy. On a May Sunday afternoon when she should be watching her Lakers in the NBA playoffs amid a raucous Crypto.com Arena, she is sitting in a quiet and virtually empty El Segundo practice facility. Her team has long since been eliminated. Her greatest of expectations became the biggest of flops. Her family’s sizable investment came up flat broke. She’s alone with her scampering Teacup Maltipoo named Delores. Jeanie Buss isn’t happy. “I’m growing impatient just because we had the fourth-highest payroll in the league. … When you spend that kind of money on the luxury tax, you expect to go deep into the playoffs,” she told The Times. “So, yeah, it was gut-wrenching for me to go out on a limb like that and not get the results that we were looking for. … I’m not happy, I’m not satisfied.” You know what happened the last time Jeanie Buss was not happy or satisfied, right? It was ugly. It was powerful. “We don’t like to be missing the playoffs, I understand the fans anger and frustration,” she said. “I’ve got to make it better.” Schedule and resultsAll times PacificConference semifinalsWestern Conference No. 1 Phoenix Suns vs. No. 4 Dallas MavericksPhoenix 121, Dallas 114Phoenix 129, Dallas 109Dallas 103, Phoenix 94Dallas 111, Phoenix 101Phoenix 110, Dallas 80 Thursday, 6:30 p.m., ESPN*Sunday, May 15, TBD No. 2 Memphis Grizzlies vs. No. 3 Golden State WarriorsGolden State 117, Memphis 116Memphis 106, Golden State 101Golden State 142, Memphis 112Golden State 101, Memphis 98Tonight at Memphis, 6:30 p.m., TNT*Friday at Golden State, TBD, ESPN*Monday at Memphis, TBD, TNT Eastern Conference No. 1 Miami Heat vs. No. 4 Philadelphia 76ersMiami 106, Philadelphia 92Miami 119, Philadelphia 103Philadelphia 99, Miami 79Philadelphia 116, Miami 108Miami 120, Philadelphia 85 Thursday at Philadelphia, 4 p.m., ESPN*Sunday at Miami, TBD No. 2 Boston Celtics vs. No. 3 Milwaukee BucksMilwaukee 101, Boston 89Boston 109, Milwaukee 86Milwaukee 103, Boston 101Boston 116, Milwaukee 108Today at Boston, 4 p.m., TNTFriday at Milwaukee, TBD, ESPN*Sunday at Boston, TBD *-if necessary 1892 — Azra, ridden by Alonzo Cayton, wins the first three-horse field in the Kentucky Derby, nipping Huron by a nose. 1918 — Exterminator, a 30-1 long shot ridden by Willie Knapp, loses the lead but regains it to win the Kentucky Derby by one length over Escoba. 1923 — Setting several Pacific Coast League records, Pete Schneider of Vernon hit five homers and a double to drive in 14 runs in a 35-11 romp over Salt Lake City. 1968 — The Montreal Canadiens win the Stanley Cup, completing a four-game sweep over the St. Louis Blues with a 3-2 victory. 1972 — The Boston Bruins win the Stanley Cup in six games with a 3-0 victory over the New York Rangers. 1992 — The Portland Trail Blazers win the highest-scoring playoff game in NBA history, 153-151 in double overtime against the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals. 1994 — The Phoenix Suns, down 104-84 with 10 minutes left, come back to force overtime and beat Houston 124-117 for a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference semifinals.

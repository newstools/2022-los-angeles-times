The last two and a half years have been incredibly difficult — many of us have lost loved ones, struggled with mental health issues and been forced to juggle working from home or working under stressful conditions with uneven child care and frustrating online learning. Did you reach out to a friend in a dark moment during this time? Did you experience joy with a friend in a text thread, a shared laugh while standing six feet apart, relief when you got to hug a dear friend after lockdown or a renewed sense of well-being by developing new and old friendships? We want to hear from you. For a story about friendship in the age of COVID-19, we’re looking for people who survived the pandemic thanks to the help of an ally. Tell us about your friend — who they are, how they assisted you and what your friend means to you today — and the story of your friendship may be included in an upcoming feature and photo essay. If you are willing to share your experience and have your photographs taken, please complete this form, and a reporter may contact you.

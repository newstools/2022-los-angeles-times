Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news. From Kevin Baxter: The Kings flew back to Edmonton on Monday afternoon in the same position they were in when they left the city last week: dead even in their best-of-seven playoff with the Oilers.  But just about everything else about the first-round series has changed. With Sunday’s feisty 4-0 win in Game 4 at Crypto.com Arena, the Kings not only matched the Oilers with two wins, they also wrested back control in a series they were on the verge of getting blown out of. What they didn’t do, coach Todd McLellan said, was change the momentum. At this time of year, he said, that can flip with every shot, every check and every save, leaving the teams to start from scratch again in Game 5 on Tuesday. “No momentum,” McLellan said. “It starts again every night. If momentum carried over, we’d have been drilled [Sunday].” Indeed. The Oilers scored 14 times to win by six goals in both the second and third games of the series, handing the Kings their most lopsided playoff losses in 32 years. Defensemen Mikey Anderson said the players took that personally. “You look at the series now, it’s back to all square,” he said. “So we try and forget about the two games we lost and turn our attention to the next one.”  But the series can’t end with the next one; Sunday’s win assured the Kings of at least one more home game Thursday. What that game will mean, McLellan said, will be determined by what his young team has learned thus far in the series. “Our team still has to improve. The big question I’m going to ask our guys is have we learned our lesson?” he said. “We win Game 1 and we do nothing in Games 2 or 3 that even looks remotely close. “Have we learned anything throughout the series? We’ll find out.”   Schedule and resultsAll times PacificFirst roundWestern Conference No. 2 Edmonton vs. No. 3 KingsKings 4, Edmonton 3Edmonton 6, Kings 0Edmonton 8, Kings 2Kings 4, Edmonton 0Tonight at Edmonton, 7 p.m., ESPN2Thursday at Kings, 7 p.m., TBS*Saturday at Edmonton, TBD No. 1 Colorado vs. WC#2 NashvilleColorado 7, Nashville 2Colorado 2, Nashville 1 (OT)Colorado 7, Nashville 3Colorado 5, Nashville 3 No. 2 Minnesota vs. No. 3 St. LouisSt. Louis 4, Minnesota 0Minnesota 6, St. Louis 2Minnesota 5, St. Louis 1St. Louis 5, Minnesota 2Tonight at Minnesota, 6:30 p.m., ESPNThursday at St. Louis, 6:30 p.m., TNT*Saturday at Minnesota, TBD No. 1 Calgary vs. WC#1 DallasCalgary 1, Dallas 0Dallas 2, Calgary 0Dallas 4, Calgary 2Calgary 4, Dallas 1Wednesday at Calgary, TBDFriday at Dallas, TBD*Sunday at Calgary, TBD Eastern Conference No. 1 Florida vs. WC#2 WashingtonWashington 4, Florida 2Florida 5, Washington 1Washington 6, Florida 1Florida 3, Washington 2 (OT)Wednesday at Florida, 4:30 p.m., ESPN2Friday at Washington, TBD*Sunday at Florida, TBD No. 2 Toronto vs. No. 3 Tampa BayToronto 5, Tampa Bay 0Tampa Bay 5, Toronto 3Toronto 5, Tampa Bay 2Tampa Bay 7, Toronto 3Today at Toronto, 4:30 p.m., ESPN2Thursday at Tampa Bay, 4:30 p.m., TBS*Saturday at Toronto, TBD No. 1 Carolina at WC#1 BostonCarolina 5, Boston 1Carolina 5, Boston 2Boston 4, Carolina 2Boston 5, Carolina 2Today at Carolina, 4 p.m., ESPNThursday at Boston, 4 p.m., TNT*Saturday at Carolina, TBD No. 2 New York Rangers vs. No. 3 Pittsburgh PenguinsPittsburgh 4, New York 3 (3 OT)New York 5, Pittsburgh 2Pittsburgh 7, New York 4Pittsburgh 7, New York 2Wednesday at New York, 4 p.m., ESPN*Friday at Pittsburgh, TBD*Sunday at New York, TBD *-if necessary From Jack Harris: Last week, Dave Roberts didn’t give Julio Urías the chance to pitch in the seventh. Facing a similar situation on Monday night, the Dodgers manager made a different decision. With his team trailing the Pittsburgh Pirates by one in the bottom of the seventh, Roberts sent Urías out to the mound to face No. 9 hitter Michael Perez. One misplaced fastball later, it immediately backfired, with Perez hitting a solo home run that helped the Pirates pull away in a 5-1 defeat of the Dodgers at PNC Park. There were plenty of causes for the Dodgers’ loss Monday, which ended the team’s six-game winning streak. Their bullpen gave up three runs in two innings. Their lineup suffered one of its quietest nights all year, matching its season-low run total and getting just four hits. And they were robbed of a couple of potential extra-base hits by diving catches from Pirates outfielders.  From Mike DiGiovanna: Tampa Bay manager Kevin Cash might have been wise to take a page out of Joe Maddon’s playbook and walk Shohei Ohtani intentionally with the bases loaded in the seventh inning Monday night, just like the Angels manager did with Texas Rangers slugger Corey Seager on April 16. Instead, Cash could only watch helplessly as Ohtani crushed a grand slam to left-center field to cap five-run rally that propelled the Angels toward an 11-3 victory over the Rays before 19,537 in Angel Stadium. Ohtani’s 413-foot shot on a 3-and-1 cut-fastball from reliever Calvin Faucher was the two-way star’s first grand slam—in Japan and the major leagues. He also hit a solo shot to left-center in the sixth inning, giving him eight multi-homer games in his big-league career and six homers on the season. The Rays had scored two runs in the top of the seventh to pull to within 6-3 of the Angels, but the Angels countered with a quick-strike rally in the bottom of the seventh. Chad Wallach, the Yorba Linda native who was making his first-ever start for the Angels, led off with a single to right, No. 9 batter Andrew Velazquez walked, and Brandon Marsh reached on a bad-hop infield single. Trout walked with the bases loaded to force in a run, and Ohtani sent his 109.8-mph drive over the wall in left-center to break open the game, helping the American League West-leading Angels (20-11) move nine games over .500 for the first time since June 9, 2018.  From Thuc Nhi Nguyen: As UCLA fell from the top of the Pac-12’s gymnastics ranks in recent years, California moved in to fill the void. While the Bruins failed to advance to the NCAA championship, the Golden Bears put together their best season in school history in 2021 and won their first Pac-12 title, sharing the regular season crown in 2022. In need of a fresh start, the Bruins turned to their in-state rivals for their next leader. UCLA hired California assistant coach Janelle McDonald to take over its gymnastics program on Monday, hoping a new voice can help one of the school’s most popular teams regain its championship luster. “Janelle has been exemplary at connecting with and developing young people at every level of her coaching career,” athletic director Martin Jarmond said in a statement. “Her enthusiasm and energy is contagious. She understands and respects the Bruin legacy and the commitment to excellence this program deserves as one of the best in the country.” The previous coaching staff, led by Chris Waller, lasted only three seasons after Waller abruptly resigned at the end of the 2022 season.

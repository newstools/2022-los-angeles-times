Evacuations were ordered in the Vacaville area of Northern California for several hours Saturday as firefighters struggled to contain a blaze that broke out earlier in the afternoon. The Quail fire had burned at least 150 acres in mountainous terrain and grassy lands by nightfall. It had begun moving toward homes when the order was issued by Solano County emergency officials, according to Cal Fire. A county official estimated there were fewer than 100 homes in the evacuation zone. The order was lifted at 8:20 p.m. There were no reports of injuries or damaged structures, officials said. The cause of the fire was under investigation. It started about 3:15 p.m. and remained out of control some three hours later. By 7:15 p.m., the fire was 45% contained, officials said. The order applied to residences on Quail Canyon Road, and from there north on Pleasant Valley Road to Highway 128 and west to the county line.

The dressing for this fresh, spring potato salad is inspired by zhoug, the fiery chile sauce from Yemen that goes well on basically anything. Here, serrano chiles add heat, but you can tame them by removing the seeds from as many chiles as you want. I prefer to leave three seedless and one with the seeds. Otherwise, there’s no spice at all to help brighten up the potatoes, cucumbers and snap peas. While cardamom may seem an odd addition to a potato salad, it’s an essential element in zhoug and offers a pleasing aroma to this salad as well.

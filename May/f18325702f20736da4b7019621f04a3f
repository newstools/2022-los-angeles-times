Sure, California is vast, fragmented and hard to define. But live here long enough and you’ll know it has an undeniably distinct vibe. It’s time we embrace it, own it, wear it on our sleeve (figuratively and literally). To pair with the L.A. Times list of 101 best California experiences, we’ve launched a collection of merch: T-shirts, joggers, hats, tote bags, water bottles and other items created to celebrate life on the West Coast. The full California Collection is available now at Shop L.A. Times.  “We were inspired by the list of quintessential California experiences and hope these pieces bring the same sense of fun and joy that our guide will,” says Jessica de Jesus, deputy design director at The Times. “We worked with L.A.-based illustrator and artist Grace Danico to create a collection featuring characters and lettering that exude a whimsical California cool.” “West Coast Weekend,” “California Person” and “Love, California” are emblazoned across the items. There’s also a sweatshirt featuring poppies, the state flower, behind the Los Angeles Times logo. You can sport the merch while working your way through the 101 best California experiences checklist. And if you want a print copy of the special issue, you can get one here. This collection was brought to life by Los Angeles Times commerce director Samantha Smith, commerce coordinator Kailen Locke, creative director Amy King, design director Taylor Le and deputy design director Jessica de Jesus. In the photos above, the clothes are modeled by Allison Hong, Elsie Ramos and Micah Fluellen from the Los Angeles Times art department and captured by staff photographer Mariah Tauger.

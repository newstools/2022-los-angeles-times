   A U.S. Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms lifted a lockdown order Monday afternoon after military police confirmed that “a weapon was inadvertently discharged.” An earlier emergency message sent to residents at the military base said they should shelter in place because of reports of an active shooter. Military police received an anonymous report around 9 a.m. of shots being fired at the base in San Bernardino County, according to Cpl. Jonathan Forrest with the Communications and Strategy Operations. “The Provost Marshalls Office is currently responding to the situation,” Forrest said. “Due to the nature of the possible situation, a shelter in place order is in effect for the base.” The emergency alert sent to housing residents read: “We’ve been advised that the base is currently in lockdown due to an active shooter. Shelter in place. Please remain inside your homes until further notice. Thank you.” But by 12:20 p.m., military police lifted the lockdown, reporting that the installation was secure and people were free to leave their homes. “At this time, we can confirm that a weapon was inadvertently discharged. No injuries have been reported. This incident is under investigation,” Marine Capt. Zachary Colvin said when reached by phone.

Touted as an interesting team on the rise, the Chargers figured to receive plenty of national exposure in 2022. On Thursday, the NFL turned that expectation into reality, announcing that coach Brandon Staley’s team will play at least five games in prime time. By so featuring the Chargers, the league is betting heavily that this will be a bunch worth watching all season. The Chargers will play Kansas City on a Thursday night, San Francisco and the Rams on Sunday nights and Denver and Indianapolis on Monday nights. With Pro Bowl quarterback Justin Herbert and his collection of offensive weapons plus a rebuilt defense, the Chargers likely will be significant playoff contenders.  They were eliminated last year on the final play of the final regular-season game, a 35-32 overtime loss in Week 18 at Las Vegas. Those two AFC West rivals will meet at SoFi Stadium on Sept. 11 to open 2022. Even before the full schedule was released, the Chargers were set to be part of NFL television history. Their previously announced Week 2 date at Kansas City will be the first game  shown exclusively on Amazon Prime Video.  The Chargers’ preseason games will come against the Rams (Aug. 13, 7 p.m. PDT) and Dallas (Aug. 20, 7 p.m.) at home, and on the road against the New Orleans Saints, time/date to be determined.

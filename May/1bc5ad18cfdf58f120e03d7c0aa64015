The Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday honored 238 officers killed in the line of duty, including a special tribute to those who died of complications from COVID-19. The ceremony featured traditional police honors: the “missing man” helicopter flyover formation, the riderless horse, a solo bugler playing taps, and the “end of watch broadcast.” Families placed a long-stem rose near their loved one’s name plate at the newly renovated memorial wall. Chief Michel Moore was to announce the inclusion of 15 officers who died in 1918-19, as a result of the Spanish flu.

Authorities in San Jose are searching for a man who was captured on surveillance video entering an apartment and taking a 3-month-old boy Monday. The incident, in the 1000 block of Elm Street, was reported at 1:03 p.m., according to the San Jose Police Department. As of Monday night, the FBI was  assisting in the search, said Sgt. Christian Camarillo, a police spokesperson. The suspect is described as a Latino man with a dark complexion, black pants, dark blue shirt, grey shoes with white trim, short hair, grey baseball hat and a black mask, police said. The baby, named Brandon Cuellar, was wearing a white, long-sleeve onesie with dinosaurs, police said. Brandon was taken from the family’s apartment while a relative was unloading groceries, Camarillo said. Video captured a  man entering the residence and leaving with the infant in a black baby carrier with a white blanket, police said.  “The family does not recognize this suspect,” police said. “Please call our detectives who are actively working this case: 408-277-4166 or 911 if you’ve seen the suspect or the baby.” Authorities set up multiple hotline numbers for anyone with tips on Brandon’s whereabouts or any information on the case: “Cash reward for info that leads to us finding this baby,” police said. “You can be anonymous.” Police also released video of the suspect walking while holding the baby carrier. An Amber Alert hasn’t been sent out on the kidnapping because authorities don’t have a vehicle description or license plate number, police said. “When we have that info, an Amber Alert will be activated,” police said.

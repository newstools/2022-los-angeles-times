The Ducks are keeping coach Dallas Eakins, picking up his contract option for the 2022-23 season, new general manager Pat Verbeek announced Tuesday. The Ducks are finishing their third consecutive losing season under Eakins, who got the job in June 2019. Anaheim is 29-33-12 heading into its game at Florida on Tuesday night. The Ducks were in the Western Conference playoff picture until the All-Star break, when they began a 6-17-3 skid that has all but guaranteed they’ll miss the postseason for a franchise-worst fourth consecutive year. “Dallas has done this job under difficult circumstances and deserves the opportunity to continue coaching this team,” Verbeek said in a statement. “We are pleased he will be returning and look forward to a promising 2022-23 season.”  Verbeek decided not to make a coaching change after taking over the franchise just two months ago. He replaced longtime GM Bob Murray, who resigned amid misconduct allegations. Verbeek also made Eakins’ job harder at the trade deadline when he shipped out four veteran contributors: defensemen Hampus Lindholm and Josh Manson and forwards Rickard Rakell and Nic Deslauriers. Eakins is just the third coach of the Ducks since billionaire Henry Samueli bought the team in 2005. Randy Carlyle led Anaheim to its only Stanley Cup title, while Bruce Boudreau won four consecutive Pacific Division titles during 4½ seasons of sustained success.

Over the next week The Times will conduct exit evaluations of the Lakers’ roster, player by player. Today’s group includes a look at forward Anthony Davis’ key stats, contract status, preseason expectations, current reality and what the future may hold. Key stats: Missed at least half of the Lakers’ games for the second straight season. Contract status: Two years remaining on deal (last a player option), owed $38 million next season. The expectation on Oct. 19: He focused on his body in the offseason and  on being reliable on the court. The reality on April 10: Maybe it was just bad luck, but a knee injury and a foot injury sunk the team’s season, keeping him off the floor and leaving the Lakers’ defense undermanned. The future: Davis will need to return to the two-way dominance he showed in his first season for the Lakers to feel good about his long-term place with the organization.

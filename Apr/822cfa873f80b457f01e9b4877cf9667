A  man suspected of pushing a woman he was arguing with into the path of a moving train in Riverside this week has been arrested and charged with murder, authorities said. Kevin Errol Lewis, 41, was charged with first-degree murder and domestic violence  in connection with Monday’s  11 incident and already faced outstanding warrants for narcotics possession and theft, police said. His bail was  set at $1 million. The victim has been identified as Mary Maltos, 52. Lewis and Maltos,  both homeless  and residing in Riverside,  were in “some sort of a relationship,” according to Riverside police  spokesperson Ryan Railsback. Witnesses told police they saw the couple arguing  around 6:35 a.m.   before Lewis pushed Maltos onto the tracks, where she was fatally struck by a  train.

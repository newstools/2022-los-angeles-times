A California Highway Patrol officer shot and wounded a suspect on the 405 Freeway early Thursday, forcing the shutdown of the southbound lanes and causing a major traffic jam during the morning rush hour as investigators gathered evidence at the scene, authorities said. The shooting occurred shortly before 3 a.m. when a Sigalert was issued, according to the CHP’s incident log. A dispatcher did not provide  information about what prompted the shooting. The wounded suspect was transported to a  hospital with unknown injuries. For several hours, both sides of the freeway were shut down, but as of 8 a.m. only the southbound side of the freeway at the Sepulveda Pass remained closed as the CHP continued its investigation of the shooting. Aerial footage from KTLA-TV showed a red vehicle pulled to the shoulder of the freeway near the Skirball Center on the southbound side of the freeway. Numerous officers walked the freeway while a few miles north traffic snarled on the 405 as drivers were directed off the major artery during the morning commute. This is a developing story.

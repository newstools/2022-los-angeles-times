Authorities in South Carolina say they are investigating a shooting at a club in Hampton County early Sunday that left at least nine people injured. It was the second mass shooting in the state in as many days. The State Law Enforcement Division said in an email there were no reported fatalities in the Easter morning shooting at the club in Hampton County. No information was immediately available on the severity of the injuries. The SLED says it was asked to investigate by the Hampton County Sheriff’s Office. Hampton County is roughly 80 miles west of Charleston. The shooting comes a day after gunfire erupted at a busy mall in the state capital of Columbia. Nine people were shot and five people suffered other injuries while trying to flee  at Columbiana Centre, Columbia Police Chief W.H. “Skip” Holbrook said in a news release Saturday. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 73. The Columbia Police Department announced the arrest of 22-year-old Jewayne M. Price, who was one of three people initially detained by law enforcement, as a person of interest in the mall shooting. Price is scheduled to have a bond hearing at 2 p.m. Sunday on charges of unlawful carrying a pistol. It was not immediately known whether Price had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Police said the 73-year-old victim continues to receive medical treatment, but the other victims have been released from  hospitals or will be released shortly. “We don’t believe this was random,” Holbrook said. “We believe they knew each other and something led to the gunfire.”

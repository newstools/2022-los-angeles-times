Over the next week The Times will conduct exit evaluations of the Lakers’ roster, player by player. Today’s group includes a look at guard Wayne Ellington’s key stats, contract status, preseason expectations, current reality and what the future may hold. Key stats: Played in 43 games, nine as a starter. Contract status: Signed to a one-year deal for $2.6 million, he’ll be a free agent this summer. The expectations on Oct. 19: The hope was that Ellington‘s outside shooting would space the court for LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook. The reality on April 10: Ellington shot a respectable 38.8% from three-point range, but he was a defensive liability. The future: It was his second tour with the Lakers, but it would be hard to imagine Ellington back next season.

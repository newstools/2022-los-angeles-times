Tiger Woods wrapped up his remarkable Masters comeback Sunday with an unremarkable 78 — matching his Saturday round — to put the finishing touches on his first competitive play in 17 months. Woods, 46, is 14 months removed from a catastrophic rollover car accident that threatened his ability to walk, let alone return to tournament golf. So the five-time Masters winner had a deep appreciation Sunday for the ovation he got from the gallery as he walked up No. 18. “It was an unbelievable feeling,” he said. “Just to have the patrons and the support out there. I wasn’t exactly playing my best out there, but just to have the support out there and the appreciation from all the fans. “I don’t think words can really describe that given where I was a little over a year ago and what my prospects were at that time to end up here and be able to play in all four rounds. Even a month ago I didn’t know if I could pull this off.” The pain he felt was evident as the tournament wore on and he walked with increasing rigidity. “It’s hard,” he said. “I have those days where I just don’t want to do anything. It just hurts, but as I alluded to earlier, I’ve had a great team around me that are super positive and have motivated me and helped me around. “It’s those days that are tough. The days I feel good are — those are easy days, but there have been more tough days than easy days. I just have to work through it, and like golf, in order to get better, you just have to go out there and put in the time.”  Woods made the cut with a 71 and 74, and had a birdie Sunday on No. 2, but had five bogeys and a double-bogey in the final 15 holes. Scores aside, he was asked if simply playing in the 2022 Masters ranks among his greatest achievements. “For not winning an event, yes,” he said. “Yes, without a doubt.”

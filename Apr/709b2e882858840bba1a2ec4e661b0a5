A woman was found dead in a Palmdale home early Saturday after Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies arrested a man who had barricaded himself inside. Deputies responded to a call at the residence in the 4300 block of Desert Aire Avenue shortly after 6 a.m. and encountered a  man they believed may have been armed who refused commands to come out of the house, authorities said. They asked for assistance from the sheriff’s Special Enforcement Bureau, a unit that trains for barricade and hostage situations and serving high-risk warrants, and neighboring homes were evacuated. The unit announced on social media shortly after 11:30 a.m. that the  operation  had concluded and the suspect was in custody. The evacuation order was  lifted. Inside the home, deputies found the body of a woman. She was  declared  dead at the scene. No information on the cause of death or the identities of the man or woman  was  available, according to a sheriff’s spokesperson.

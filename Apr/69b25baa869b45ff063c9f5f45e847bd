Desert Dawn had just pulled a major upset by winning the Grade 2 $400,000 Santa Anita Oaks by defeating the heavily favored Adare Manor by a neck. Yet winning jockey Umberto Rispoli had a problem. Photos were being taken and he was slotted to stand in the Winner’s Circle between two Rams players, 6-foot-6 tight end Kendall Blanton and 6-5 linebacker Justin Hollins. So, he did the only thing he could do, he jumped up and sat on the railing behind everyone so he could be on the same level as the others for the picture.

She gave me the Santa Anita Oaks and now it is on to Kentucky.” Desert Dawn, who paid $31.20, $7.40 and $3.20, also is headed to Kentucky as she qualified for the Kentucky Oaks, held the day before the Kentucky Derby. Adare Manor was second followed by Ain’t Easy, Under the Stars and Micro Share. Phil D’Amato was the winning trainer of the 1-1/16-mile race for 3-year-old fillies. Rispoli also won two other races on Saturday’s seven-stakes card, one of them the Grade 2 $200,000 Royal Heroine for older fillies and mares going a mile on the turf. The race scratched to four horses and Going Global rallied on the far turn to win by 1¾ lengths. D’Amato, once again, was the winning trainer.

Gilbert Gottfried, beloved comedian and voice of the parrot Iago in “Aladdin,” has died after a long battle with an illness. He was 67. “We are heartbroken to announce the passing of our beloved Gilbert Gottfried after a long illness,” the performer’s family wrote in a statement shared Tuesday on social media. “In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend and father to his two young children. Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in Gilbert’s honor.” Gottfried was revered for his brash, irreverent style of stand-up comedy. The renowned voice actor was also known for lending his piercing, squawky vocals to Jafar’s avian minion in the Disney animated classic “Aladdin,” as well as the instantly recognizable Aflac duck.

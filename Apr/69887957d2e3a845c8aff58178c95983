What was initially reported to be a 4.0 earthquake Friday morning 16 miles from the city of Avalon on Catalina Island was, in fact, not an earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said. In a tweet, the USGS said ShakeAlert, an earthquake early-warning system, “detected a non-earthquake event which triggered our system. Fortunately, no public alerts were sent out. This is a bit of a first time for us because these events happen so rarely.” Although this turned out not to be an earthquake, you’ll still want to be ready for the next big quake.

A stolen firearm used in the mass shooting in Sacramento on Sunday was converted to be used as a fully automatic weapon, police said. Authorities did not offer more details about the weapon, but some handguns can be modified to fire like a machine gun. There had been suspicion that an automatic weapon was used in the shooting because video of the incident recorded rapid gunfire. The shooting left six people dead and a dozen more wounded. Officials estimate at least 100 shots were fired.

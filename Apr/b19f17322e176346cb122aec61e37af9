Long Beach police are searching for a motorist who fatally struck a female pedestrian, abandoned the damaged vehicle and fled the scene. The collision occurred near the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Harbor Avenue around 11:35 p.m on Apr. 20., according to Brandon Fahey, a police department spokesman. Police arriving on the scene found the female victim suffering from critical injuries. She was later declared dead at the scene, Fahey said. The unidentified female victim, approximately 30 to 40 years old, is believed to have been homeless, according to police. She was walking in a marked crosswalk when she was hit by the vehicle. The suspect’s vehicle, a 2002 Toyota Avalon, was found abandoned several blocks away on Santa Fe Avenue. There were no other details immediately available, including  a description of the suspect, who remained at large. The investigation is ongoing. A fatal hit-and-run is a felony in the state of California and the driver, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.

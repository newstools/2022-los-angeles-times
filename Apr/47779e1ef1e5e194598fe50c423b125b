This seafood boil is an homage to the crawfish boils of Louisiana, with a Sicilian twist courtesy of the addition of oranges and artichokes steeped in the broth. You can use this same method with crabs, lobsters or, as I do here, shrimp tails. The spices used to flavor the broth are meant to mimic those in the Zatarain’s brand Crawfish, Shrimp & Crab Boil mix — if you can find that in your grocery store, use it instead. Serve the boil in a giant heatproof platter with lots of napkins and no silverware to encourage your guests to eat with their fingers. Take bites of the potatoes and sausages as you eat everything else to give your mouth a break from all the spice. This dish is meant to be pretty spicy, but if you want to keep it mild, simply omit the cayenne in the finishing seasoning.

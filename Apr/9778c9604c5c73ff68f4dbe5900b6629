The Orange County coroner identified two of three people found dead early this month at an Irvine home, the scene of a possible murder-suicide. Karina Poirier, 55, and Serge Poirier, 63, were found with another adult April 6 at a home at 58 Riverboat by Irvine police. Their bodies were “severely decomposed,” police said at the time. The deceased were believed to be a mother, father and son, authorities said. Detectives believe the third person is Morgan Poirier, 21, the Irvine Police Department said Friday in a release, adding that coroner’s officials were using DNA to make a positive identification. All three people sustained a gunshot wound, and a gun was found at the scene, police said in the release. Irvine officers had responded to the home for a welfare check on behalf of Canadian authorities after extended family members said they had not heard from relatives for over a year, police officials said this month. Officers did not find any signs of forced entry and said it appeared to be a domestic incident that ended in a murder-suicide.

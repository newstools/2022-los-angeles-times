Authorities have set up a perimeter around Northridge Fashion Center after a 911 caller reported seeing possible robbery suspects inside the mall. Officers responded around 2:40 P.M. to the 9300 block of Tampa Avenue, said Officer Matthew Cruz, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson. At some point, officers chased the suspects’ vehicle — a burgundy sedan, Cruz said. As of around 5 p.m., authorities had set up a perimeter around the mall and were searching for the four suspects, he said. Information on whether any shots were fired wasn’t immediately available. This is a developing story and will be updated.

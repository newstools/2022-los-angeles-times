A person was reported dead after a small plane crashed Wednesday alongside the 210 Freeway in Sylmar, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. The incident, involving a single-engine, private plane, was reported just before 12:30 p.m. Fire crews responded to the scene and confirmed that one person had died in the crash. No other occupants were found after a search of the surrounding area, officials said. Damage to the plane was extensive and resulted in a small fuel leak that was contained by fire personnel. The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration were notified of the crash and launched investigations. The plane was expected to remain at the scene for at least several hours as agencies worked to investigate. The Hubbard Street onramp to the westbound 210 was closed due to the incident as of 1:15 p.m., California Highway Patrol officials said. An airport of origin for the plane has not been identified by officials, but Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, whose district includes Sylmar, pointed to Whiteman Airport nearby in Pacoima.  “Tragically, another life cut short by plane crash,” she said in a statement. “Pending confirmation of its departure, the frequency of these incidents should warrant an immediate closure and investigation over the private operations at Whiteman Airport out of respect for the lives of the victims, their families and our community.” In January, a Cessna crashed onto train tracks in Pacoima and was hit by a Metrolink train after it had taken off from Whiteman Airport.

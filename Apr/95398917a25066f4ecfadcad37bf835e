After stepping off a private plane at LAX, rapper ASAP Rocky was  arrested Wednesday morning on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon in connection with a November incident where Los Angeles police say he shot at a person in Hollywood. The musician arrived at the airport on his way back from Barbados, where he was vacationing with singer Rihanna, his girlfriend who is pregnant with the couple’s first child. Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was taken into custody by LAPD Robbery Homicide Division and booked for assault, according to LAPD Capt. Jonathan Tippet. On Nov. 6, 2021 around 10:15 p.m., an argument between two acquaintances occurred near Selma Avenue and Argyle Avenue in the Hollywood area. The argument escalated and resulted in  one firing a handgun at the  other, according to law enforcement. The victim sustained a minor injury and later sought medical treatment. Following the shooting, the suspect, who was identified as Mayers, and two additional males fled the area on foot. Mayers, 33, was previously convicted of assault in Sweden when he was there for a festival performance in the summer of 2019. Mayers and two members of his entourage were accused of aggravated assault. In August 2019, he was convicted during a trial in which a judge heard evidence about a street brawl in Stockholm in late June in which the rapper was accused of stomping on a man after throwing him to the ground.  Mayers testified and maintained that he was acting in self-defense. A judge determined the incident was not worthy of prison time.   Representatives for the rapper did not immediately respond Wednesday to The Times’ request for comment.

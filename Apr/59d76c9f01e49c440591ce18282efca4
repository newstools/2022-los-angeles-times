Rayshon Luke of St. John Bosco High was the fastest freshman in the state in 2019. He didn’t run track during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. He’s back with a vengeance for his senior year. A standout running back committed to Arizona, Luke ran the 100 meters in 10.32 seconds on Saturday at the Mt. SAC Relays to claim second behind junior Nyckoles Harbor II (10.28) of Archbishop Carroll in Washington, D.C. It was a school record. The state‘s No. 1 sprinter, Max Thomas of Servite, didn’t get to run in the race because of a false start. It’s shaping up as a Trinity League showdown between Luke and Thomas in the coming weeks to decide the fastest in California, along with Gardena Serra’s Rodrick Pleasant. St. John Bosco set a school record in the 400  relay in 40.80. Jaelen Knox of Long Beach Poly won the 200 running 20.85. Thomas was second at 20.94.  In the girls’ 100, Reign Redmond of Carson won the 100 in 11.74. Kayland Edwards of Long Beach Wilson took the girls’ 300 hurdles in 44.50.

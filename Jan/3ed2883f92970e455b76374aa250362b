If you’re baby-stepping into composting for the first time, the do’s and don’ts of what goes into the bin might seem daunting. To flatten the learning curve, we’ve compiled two reference lists — one of things that should never go in the compost pile and another of items that should only go in “hot” compost piles (more about that below) — to help guide you. The following items should never be placed in any compost pile (or organic waste bin, for that matter):  Hot composting needs the  compost pile to reach an internal temperature of 130 to 150 degrees (to kill the pathogens that meat, dairy and diseased plants produce), so if you’re trying this at home you’ll need to invest in a compost thermometer and more time than you’d need with casual composting.    The items below can go into a hot compost pile at home or most municipal food waste/organic waste bins, where they will be sent to facilities that use hot composting techniques. (Note that rules vary by city or town, so check with your jurisdiction to make sure these are items they will accept.)

It’s late January, a time for garden rejuvenation, reflection and a few reminders, as in: Have you finished pruning your roses yet? And have you planted at least a couple of fragrant, flowering native plants in your yard or in containers, to support our local birds and pollinators? This is also the month to start thinking about delicious summer fruit. If you can add a fruit tree or berry bush to your yard or patio, February and early March are the time to do it because nurseries are full of bare-root fruit varieties. Be sure you choose a variety that grows well in your region because some trees, such as apples, pears and soft fruits like peaches and cherries, require a certain number of “chill hours” — hours when the temperature ranges between 32 and 45 degrees — to produce fruit. Thus, most Southern California gardeners need trees that require a low number of chill hours. The California Rare Fruit Growers website lists nurseries that sell a large variety of fruit trees, but notes also that the list is incomplete. Check in with the organization’s local chapters, such as the Foothill chapter in the San Gabriel Valley or the West Los Angeles chapter, to get advice about varieties that grow best in your specific region, and stay tuned for after the pandemic because these chapters usually offer classes in pruning and growing all kinds of fruits, rare or not. And just a quick note on the native plant front: MyNB, an app for the city of Newport Beach, now includes photos and information about the native plants growing in the city’s Civic Center Park and Sculpture Exhibition, near Fashion Island and the Pacific Coast Highway.

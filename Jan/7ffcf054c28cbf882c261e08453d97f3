This marmalade comes from Sonoko Sakai and Alaina Wong, who collaborate to turn Sakai’s backyard oro blanco tree harvest into a bejeweled fruit preserve. This recipe takes two days and uses all of the grapefruit — juice, pith and rind — so, if possible, use high-quality, organic fruits. Use a 12-quart pan and do not double the recipe. The mixture should not be more than two-thirds of the pan’s volume, as it will affect the texture and color of the marmalade. Oro blancos are common in Southern California markets this time of year, but if you can’t find them, use another fragrant, sweet grapefruit variety like ruby red.

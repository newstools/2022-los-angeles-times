Remember rain? You know, that wet stuff that used to fall out of the sky in Southern California around January and February? Well, once again in drought-leaning SoCal, the precipitation predictions look pretty bleak, with dry blue skies forecast well into March. But that just makes the need for a water barrel all the more important, because when we do get rain, SoCal gardeners will want to save every drop they can. For those Angelenos who already have rain barrels, L.A. Sanitation is offering a free webinar on March 5 at 10:30 a.m. about how to maintain those rain capturers. Pre-registration is required. For those who don’t have rain barrels, now is the time to get them installed, especially since the Metropolitan Water District is offering up to two $35 rebates for rain barrels that hold 50 to 199 gallons. They also have rebates of $250 to $350 for cisterns that store 200 to more than 1,000 gallons. In the meantime, take advantage of our relatively mild weather to attend some flower shows, plant sales and gardening classes now into March. Email garden- and plant-related events to jeanette.marantos@latimes.com at least three weeks before they happen, and we might include them in the calendar.

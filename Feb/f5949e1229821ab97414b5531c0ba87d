Midcentury Modern design is forever linked with Palm Springs, where homes by famed architects William Cody, John Lautner, Albert Frey and Hugh Kaptur are preserved alongside the 1960s-era motor lodges, gas stations and post offices that have been transformed into hip resorts and restaurants. Modernism‘s enormous popularity is enduring thanks to its simplicity,   and it’s celebrated in a big way at Palm Springs’ Modernism Week, an annual festival of 20th-century design held this year from Feb. 17 through Feb. 27, bringing with it more than 350 events including house tours, panel discussions, bike and walking tours and parties. Many events, such as tours of Sunnylands and Frank Sinatra’s Twin Palms estate, sell out quickly, but there are still plenty of events left to choose from. Here, we offer  13 events that, as of our deadline, are still available. For a list of all events, and to purchase tickets, go to modernismweek.com.

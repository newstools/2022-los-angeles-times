Authorities are searching for a man who was shot by Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies in Norwalk on Thursday night. The shooting occurred shortly after 7 p.m. in the 12100 block of Foster Road, said Deputy Miguel Meza, a spokesman for the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department. At least one deputy opened fire and hit the suspect, who was armed, Meza said. A Sheriff’s Department statement later clarified that the man was hit once “in the lower extremities.” It wasn’t clear what prompted the shooting. Initial information was limited. Deputies set up a containment zone and searched for the man, Meza said. Authorities believed the man entered a home on Foster Road after being shot, according to KTLA-TV Channel 5. The man was not in custody as of 10:30 p.m., deputies said.  Further information was not available.

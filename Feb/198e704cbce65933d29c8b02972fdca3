Colton Underwood won’t be “The Bachelor” much longer: Less than a year after coming out as gay, the former star of the ABC dating show is engaged to political strategist Jordan C. Brown. The news came courtesy of People, but it was backed up on social media with messages from both men. “life is going to be fun with you,” Underwood, 30, wrote Monday on Instagram, posting a photo of himself and his fiancé walking in the woods. “The only time in my life I’m ok with wasting a bottle of champagne. I love you babe,” Brown, 37, posted on his own page, captioning a photo of the two of them celebrating by spraying a bottle of bubbly on a bluff with the ocean in the background. Brown and Underwood, the star of Netflix’s “Coming Out Colton,” have been dating since last summer. They didn’t provide too many details of the engagement beyond revealing where it happened. “After my birthday, Jordan and I went to Big Sur for a weekend getaway to decompress and relax in nature,” Underwood told People. “I couldn’t have pictured a more beautiful place to celebrate an amazing milestone in my life and relationship.” The former NFL player, who said in the Netflix doc that he initially “didn’t want to be gay,” called 2021 the “most transformative year”  of his life.  The engagement news comes just two weeks after  Underwood wrote to Brown on Instagram, “This valentines day is a special one. I get to love who I want and I love loving on you.”

I want those championing freedomthe patriots of peacethe ones who march into our schoolshandcuff our historyhold our imaginations hostagethe so-called American dreamers I want themto uncage their heartsto cast off their chains of fearto remember the bedtime storiesthat comforted themwhen nightmares chased sleep away to remember the first-grade teacherswho read them pictured fablesthat showed them how to love themselvesand planted the seeds of possibilitythat blossomed into their becoming to remember how hopeful it feltto be held by their mother’s songs and poemson nights when thunderravaged the sky. I want them to knowthat banning a bookis like banning a hugand that is a dismal stormno child should be left behind in.

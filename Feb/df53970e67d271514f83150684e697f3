Hi there! I’m Yvonne Villarreal, TV writer for The Times and “The Envelope” podcast co-host. It’s already been a couple of months, but I know I’m not the only person still thinking about “Succession’s” Season 3 finale. That’s why I invited Kieran Culkin, who plays Roman on the show, to break down some of the most talked-about moments, including that scene where the siblings unite and Gerri’s betrayal. His takes added a new layer to the show that I didn’t even know I was missing. Plus, we talked about his upbringing as a child actor, why conjuring up his family’s past doesn’t actually help him in scenes and the Jeremy Strong New Yorker article. You can listen to the full conversation now wherever you get your podcasts or on latimes.com, where you can also read the full transcript.

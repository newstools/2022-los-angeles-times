Drew Peterson had 24 points and 10 rebounds as No. 16 USC extended its winning streak to five games, beating Oregon State 94-91 in double-overtime on Thursday night. Isaiah Mobley had 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Trojans (24-4, 13-4 Pac-12). “They’ve had a few tough breaks this year, but they’re a very good basketball team, especially when they play like they did tonight,” USC coach Andy Enfield said of Oregon State. “They showed a lot of heart. We were fortunate to grind out a double overtime victory on the road.” Dashawn Davis scored 27 of his career-high 31 points in the second half and overtime for Oregon State (3-23, 1-15), which lost its 13th straight game. Jarod Lucas added 18 points. “I was just playing my game, having fun,” said Davis, who missed a 3-pointer from the right corner with three seconds left in the second overtime. He scored the Beavers’ final 19 points in regulation, converted a jumper in the lane, tying the game at 83-all with 19 seconds left in the first overtime. Dexter Akanno blocked Peterson’s potential game-winning jumper, extending the game to a second OT. Davis hit a 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds left in regulation to tie the game at 75-all.  “I was really proud of the fact that we didn’t back down,” Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle said. “They never doubted that we were going to pull that one out.” USC’s edge at the foul line was key. The Trojans were 21 of 25 at the line. The Beavers went 12 of 22. Davis scored on an array of jumpers and drives in his best game of the season that also included seven assists. “We were short-handed a little bit (with Boogie Ellis and Isaiah White out), but our other guys stepped up and played very well,” Enfield said, adding that he’s proud of his team for 24 regular-season wins. USC went on an 11-0 run late in the first half to extend the lead to 38-27, but Oregon State finished the half strong. Lucas made a 3-pointer, and Davis had a steal and a dunk, cutting the deficit to 40-33 at the break.

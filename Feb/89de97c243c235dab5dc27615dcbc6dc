- Your heart out. - Your words. - Crow. - Humble pie. - Your fear. - Which, in turn, will eat your soul. - The garnish on your cherimoya margarita in the Maestro Dobel tequila booth. Food.  Seriously, stuff some sandwiches into your Yeezy Gap Round Jacket, because there is not a lick of food to be had anywhere on the various acres that compose the fair site. Gone are the stands that dispense stale, pricey muffins and exorbitant Cokes — which at least offer sustenance. On its website’s FAQ page, Frieze lists two food options: Restaurants inside the hotel itself, Circa 55 and Sant’olina. But you’ll need reservations. (Good luck with that!) Thinking of venturing out for food? No prob, if you’re a VIP with an all-access pass. But it’s wildly unclear if general admission ticket holders are allowed to re-enter the site after leaving. Sadly, Beverly Hills is too cruel a mistress to allow bacon dog vendors around the perimeter of the fair. And, to put it mildly, the perimeter is rather dire:  Next year, I would advise that Frieze take a page from Art Los Angeles Contemporary, which in 2019 had a Moon Juice stand on-site dispensing activated maca mesquite walnuts. I can make a desperate meal out of that.

This dip is a merger of my favorite fried onion dip with spicy Sichuan chili crisp. Both dishes start out the same: with frying onions. I add garlic, chiles and spices to the mix and then stir them together for a creamy dip with a wonderfully warm kick. The ground Sichuan peppercorns and MSG are optional, but if you have one or all of them, add them for a more aromatic dip. Normally averse to such things, I actually prefer “lite” sour cream for this dip since you stir in ½ cup of oil from frying the onions. If you added that to regular sour cream, it’d be too rich to eat, even for game day.

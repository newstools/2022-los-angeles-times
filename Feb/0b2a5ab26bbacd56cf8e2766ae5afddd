To the editor: Black History Month is a time for pride, reflection and goal setting. Black History Month is a time to research, explore and appreciate our culture and our heritage as Black people. As a teacher and coach at Dorsey High in the Los Angeles Unified School District, I think of Black History Month as a time to study and recognize the outstanding accomplishments of Black people in America and throughout the world and gain insight and inspiration. It is a time to use that inspiration to continue to strive for excellence in all that we do and to make our ancestors proud of us. It is a time to use historical examples to remind ourselves and our youth how to love one another and how to be proud as a people. It is a time to get back to our roots and also a time to plan for our futures. It is a time to love being Black and to make sure that we are adding a solid layer of bricks to the existing wall that represents our journey, which is called the Black experience in America. Black History Month is all about love — the love of being Black, the love of our forefathers, the love of ourselves and the love of our future generations. Irvin L.

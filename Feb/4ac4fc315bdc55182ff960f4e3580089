In 2014, Dr. Joseph Englanoff paid $5 million for an empty plot of land in the hills of Bel-Air. He spent the next seven years crafting an amenity-loaded mega-mansion on the property, and the home has finally surfaced for sale at $139 million. If he gets his price, it will be Bel-Air’s second-priciest home sale ever. The record was set in 2019 when Lachlan Murdoch paid $150 million for the famed “Beverly Hillbillies” mansion. The $139-million tag also makes it the third-priciest home currently on the market in L.A. County.  Coincidentally, the top spot belongs to The One, another Bel-Air mega-mansion listed for $295 million that’s set to be auctioned off due to foreclosure if it can’t find a buyer soon. Englanoff, who doubles as a real estate investor, is a lender on that property, and he’s owed about $36 million. While most Bel-Air mansions come with a laundry list of amenities, Englanoff’s latest creation, called La Fin, brings new meaning to the word. There are: Elsewhere are 12 bedrooms and 15.5 bathrooms. The grand living spaces open to a wraparound patio overlooking L.A., as well as a rooftop deck. The 2-acre estate also includes a guest penthouse, outdoor lounge, a handful of lawns and multiple caretaker residences. Adam Rosenfeld and Jon Grauman of the Agency hold the listing.

Drew Peterson scored 20 points, including the game-winning three-pointer with 11.5 seconds remaining, and No. 16 USC defeated Oregon 70-69 on Saturday night. Isaiah Mobley added 17 points for the Trojans (25-4, 14-4 Pac-12 Conference), who set a school record for most wins in the regular season. “Very proud of [our] players. We played an outstanding game,” USC coach Andy Enfield said. “It was a hostile environment, a lot of energy in the building. It was a great crowd. Their students were swearing at our players and throwing things in the tunnel afterwards, but we came through with a big road win.” Quincy Guerrier scored 15 points for Oregon (18-10, 11-6), while De’Vion Harmon added 13, N’Faly Dante had 12 and Jacob Young scored 11.  The Ducks shot 38.7% from the field, including six for 23 on three-pointers. “I thought we rushed a few of them,” Oregon coach Dana Altman said of the three-pointers. “I thought we were too aggressive at times. We [want] guys to be aggressive, but I thought we rushed a few.”  Guerrier put the Ducks ahead 69-67 on a three-pointer with 23 seconds remaining before Peterson answered with his three-pointer. Oregon’s Will Richardson missed a shot at the buzzer. “That was definitely cool,” Peterson said. “We set a high ball screen, and they went under it. I saw a bit of space and decided to pull up. Thankfully it went in. Then we got a stop. We worked our butts off tonight. Everyone contributed, and we won in a crazy environment.” With 3:04 left to play, Young beat the shot clock with a deep three-pointer to put Oregon ahead 64-61 before Mobley made two free throws for the Trojans. Harmon then drove for an Oregon basket before Max Agbonkpolo answered with a bucket to get USC to within 66-65 with 1:26 to play. Mobley drove for a basket that put the Trojans up 67-66 with 41 seconds left, but Guerrier followed with a three-pointer for the Ducks.  USC went up 51-45 on a dunk by Chevez Goodwin before Harmon followed with a three-pointer for the Ducks. Kobe Johnson followed with a bucket for the Trojans before Oregon scored six straight points to take the lead on two free throws by Dante. The Trojans went back into the lead on a three-pointer by Mobley with 7:52 left in the game. Oregon rallied from an 12-point deficit in the first half to take a 32-31 lead at the break.

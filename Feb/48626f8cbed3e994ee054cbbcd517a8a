Leon Draisaitl scored twice and the Edmonton Oilers routed the Ducks 7-3 on Thursday night to remain unbeaten under new head coach Jay Woodcroft. Evander Kane, Derek Ryan, Jesse Puljujarvi, Warren Foegele and Zach Hyman also scored for the Oilers, who are 9-1-2 in their last 12 outings and 4-0 under Woodcroft. Mike Smith made 27 saves. Connor McDavid and Ryan McLeod each chipped in a pair of assists. Adam Henrique, Sonny Milano and Trevor Zegras scored for the Ducks, who have lost four in a row. John Gibson allowed seven goals on 41 shots. Anaheim took the lead with a power-play goal 4:39 into the opening period as Henrique tipped a  shot by Cam Fowler past Smith. The Ducks got another power-play score with six minutes left in the first period, as a shot by Zegras was redirected into the net by Milano, his 11th. Edmonton got on the board with a power-play goal with 1:14 left in the first as Kane sent a wrist shot past Gibson for his fourth goal in nine games as a member of the Oilers. After a video review denied an Anaheim goal, the Oilers pulled even four minutes into the middle period as Ryan tipped a long shot by Cody Ceci into the net.  Edmonton moved ahead 7:26 into the second period as Puljujarvi scored his 12th, flubbing a shot off his own skate and past Gibson. Puljujarvi was injured on the play and ended up leaving the game. The Oilers added another goal at about the midway mark of the second as a nice feed from McLeod allowed Draisaitl to tap home his 34th. Edmonton scored its fifth consecutive goal 4:21 into the third on a one-timer by Foegele. Anaheim got one back midway through the third when Zegras scored high over Smith. Draisaitl restored the three-goal lead, stripping a puck and then sending home his second of the game — his 12th multiple-goal game of the season. Just over a minute late, Hyman scored his 16th on a backhand.

I have a confession: In the past few months I’ve ghosted at least five people. I’ve also been ghosted by plenty more. It’s a reality of online dating that isn’t always easy or purposeful for the ghoster but can be devastating for the ghostee. With Valentine’s Day approaching, we want to hear your L.A. ghosting stories. Fill out the form below. We will read your stories and publish a selection on Feb. 14 — because Valentine’s Day isn’t just for happy couples; it can also be about loving yourself (and dishing about dating horror stories).

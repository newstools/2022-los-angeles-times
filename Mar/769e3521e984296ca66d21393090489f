No one is “Dune” it like shirtless Timothée Chalamet at the Academy Awards. Twitter went into a  frenzy Sunday after the “Dune” star and Certified Internet Boyfriend rolled up to the Oscars’ red carpet in a sparkly black blazer, dress pants, a silver necklace and no shirt. Absolutely none. “I’m breathing perfectly fine,” tweeted one person in response to a photo of Shirtless Chalamet posted by Times reporter Amy Kaufman. “pls help me,” tweeted another. In February, Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi epic received Oscar nominations for adapted screenplay, cinematography, costume design, editing, makeup and hairstyling, original score, production design, sound, visual effects and best picture. In “Dune” — based on the Frank Herbert novel of the same name — Chalamet plays protagonist Paul Atreides, whose noble family is involved in a political war over the desert planet Arrakis. At the Oscars, Chalamet was joined by his “Dune” co-stars Josh Brolin, Jason Momoa and Zendaya, who also turned heads — per usual — in a white, silk crop top and shimmering silver skirt.  “okay i get it now he is so hot,” another person tweeted Sunday in reaction to Chalamet’s Oscars apparel — or lack thereof. “this is why dune should win best picture,” wrote one Twitter user. Of course, not everyone was a fan of the peekaboo look. “Shirtless to the oscars... Why,” tweeted one user. “someone offer him a shirt,” remarked another. “the red hot chili peppers do this every night. not impressed,” someone else wrote.

Kings rookie Arthur Kaliyev had his first two-goal game in the NHL, Phillip Danualt also scored and Cal Petersen stopped 38 shots. Los Angeles had lost two straight after winning five in a row. It had won its previous six road games. Dallas trailed 3-1 after Kaliyev’s second goal, a power-play strike with 6:43 left in the second period.

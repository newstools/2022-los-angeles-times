With the season on the line, there never was any doubt who Sherman Oaks Notre Dame would turn to in the fourth quarter of Thursday’s Southern California Division I regional game against St. Anthony.

Shtolzberg finished with 25 points and Stromer had 20 points. Elijah Price led St. Anthony with 22 points and Jaayden Bush had 15 points. Notre Dame fell behind by eight points in the third quarter but received a huge boost from unsung reserve Omari Garrett, who scored on a tip and a layup to keep the Knights within striking distance and set the stage for Notre Dame’s dynamic duo to take over.

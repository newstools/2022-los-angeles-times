A man was stabbed repeatedly while walking in Chinatown this week in what appears to be a random attack, Los Angeles police said. William Yu, 46, was walking near the intersection of Alpine Street and Broadway on Wednesday afternoon when he was approached by the assailant, police said. Yu had wounds in his head and neck, along with lacerations to his groin and stomach, they said. Yu’s brother David wrote in a social media post about the attack: “As people called police, nobody helped to intervene. … My brother was in the fight for his life.” Yu was recovering Friday evening after being released from the hospital, his brother said, but was tired and in pain Yu is his parents’ main caretaker, according to his brother. “Thank goodness nothing vital was damaged. But when he was attacked he was really cut up,” David Yu said. “He thought he was just getting punched. He thought he was just getting into a fight.” Timothy Mears, 50,  was arrested at the scene. According to jail records,  his bail was set at $100,000. LAPD Officer Rosario Cervantes said that Mears was charged with mayhem and that detectives will determine whether additional charges will be pursued. “It’s just a sad situation for everyone and at least for the city,” David Yu said. The family has started a GoFundMe campaign to help with his brother’s medical bills.

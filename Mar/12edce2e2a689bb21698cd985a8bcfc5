There have been many top shooters who came to Fairfax High and left raving. Rob Diaz of JSerra was the latest Tuesday night, making seven three-pointers and finishing with 37 points to help his team hold off Fairfax 70-68 in a first-round game of the Southern California Division I regional basketball playoffs. His assistant coach, Taylor King, once scored nearly 50 points in a summer game at Fairfax for Santa Ana Mater Dei. He joked with Diaz afterward, “Almost as good as me.” “It was crazy,” Diaz said. “I would gladly play every game here.” JSerra needed every point from Diaz because Fairfax went on a 20-0 run after falling behind 56-39 to take a 59-56 lead with less than six minutes left. Tyler Bey led the comeback and finished with 24 points. A basket by Diaz with 33 seconds left gave JSerra a two-point cushion. Fairfax worked for a final shot, but a turnover enabled JSerra to advance to a second-round game against top-seeded Damien. Damien defeated Mission Hills 81-50.

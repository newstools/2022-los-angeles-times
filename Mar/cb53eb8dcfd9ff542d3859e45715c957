Participants in the 37th annual L.A. Marathon on Sunday can expect ideal Southern California weather conditions for the big race, which is expected to draw thousands of runners. Partly cloudy skies early Sunday are expected to give way to sunny skies and cool temperatures for most of the day, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures will range from the mid-60s to the mid-70s, with winds of 15 to 25 mph out of the northwest. Saturday will likely see mostly cloudy skies, with highs in the mid-60s. There is a 50% chance of rain in some areas during the evening hours. The marathon is expected to include roughly 15,000 runners from around the country — and the world — covering a 26.2-mile course that spans some of L.A.'s most iconic neighborhoods. The 2022 route mirror’s last  year’s to a tee — including a twist at the end that departs from earlier races (prior to 2021). Runners will begin at Dodger Stadium, turn toward downtown and sail under the Chinatown Dragon Gate, past Olvera Street and through Little Tokyo before turning northwest past Echo Park Lake and into Hollywood. Wheelchair-using participants will start at 6:30 a.m., followed by elite women runners at 6:45 a.m. and elite men at 6:55 a.m. The race continues through Beverly Hills — with a view of tony Rodeo Drive — into West. L.A. Runners will then double back on San Vicente, Sepulveda and Santa Monica boulevards before finishing at Avenue of the Stars.  Dozens of roads and freeway ramps will close to make way for the runners.  Freeway ramps for northbound and southbound lanes of the 110 and 101 freeways, as well as southbound 405 Freeway, will be affected at different times during the race.

To the editor: We didn’t need yet another reason to dump the pump and go electric, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has given us one by attacking Ukraine. (“Rising gas prices from Russia-Ukraine conflict will hit Angelenos who can least afford it,” March 1) In addition to contributing to the deaths of more than 7 million people every year from pollution, those who buy gasoline keep demand for oil high, which pushes the price up for everybody. Russia is a petro-state, meaning the government gets most of its revenue from selling oil, and when the price is high, Moscow makes more money. Those who buy gasoline are helping Putin pay for his war of aggression against Ukraine. The oil industry helped elect Donald Trump president in 2016 and tried to get him reelected.

To the editor: I have some suggestions for dealing with higher gas prices because of the war in Ukraine.  First, drive smaller vehicles or use public transportation whenever possible.

We must support right against might and do the right thing even when — especially when — it’s difficult. Susan Wolfson, Glendale

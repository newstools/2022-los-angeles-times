Pain at the pump in California continued Tuesday, as the average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline in Los Angeles County exceeded $6 even as the average price nationwide continues to drop. In L.A., the average cost of $6.01 per gallon topped California’s average of $5.86 and the nationwide average of $4.24, according to the American Automobile Assn. Neighboring Southern California counties aren’t far behind, with the average price of a gallon of regular-grade gas in Orange County at $5.97, in Ventura County at $5.95, in San Bernardino County at $5.90 and in Riverside County at $5.88. The average price of a gallon of gas in L.A. County topped $5 for the first time less than a month ago — on March 3. Across the nation, the average gas price peaked at $4.33 per gallon on March 11 and has since dropped 9 cents. The California average continues to steadily increase, and the gap between county and state prices has also widened, from 1.2% at the beginning of March to 2.6% as of Tuesday.

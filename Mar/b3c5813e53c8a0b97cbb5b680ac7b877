 Slip on one of designer Brittany Simone’s hats for a night out when the sun goes down and the temps dip.  The drape of this robe gives it such a feeling of comfort and chicness, you could get away with wearing it out of the house — but why would you want to do that?  This beautiful cape set by Indian designer duo Diya Rajvvir is made for your next spring reveal. It’s available on ShopKynah.com, where the online shop’s founder Aisha Rawji curates a number of Indian artists and designers that have not been previously available to U.S. customers. Diya Rajvvir Yellow Border Print Cape Set $574 “Qi” (Or chi, pronounced “chee”) means life force or life energy. Add flower teas to your beverage game, sourced from small farmers across Asia. Essential oils, and the benefits of aromatherapy, should be your next travel essential, whether your trip is to Ralphs or Mexico City.  Never buy only one lip balm. This SPF 30 lip balm set gives iconic desserts their due. Choose Bananas Foster or maybe just an After Dinner Mint. This collaboration between the luxury brand and Maison Tamboite pays homage to French craftsmanship and Louis Vuitton’s heritage. The details are immaculate.

Kobe Bryant’s signature shoes will again be produced by Nike, his widow, Vanessa, announced on Instagram Thursday afternoon. Bryant’s  Nike shoes are some of the most popular in the NBA, but last spring, his contract with the shoemaker expired. Thursday, in a post, Vanessa Bryant said the shoes would be back. “We’re excited to announce our partnership with Nike is going to continue! I am so proud that my husband’s shoes are still the most worn by players on NBA courts and the demand for his shoes remain so desired by his fans around the world,” she wrote. Demand for Bryant’s models has gone up since his contract with Nike expired. Lakers Anthony Davis and Malik Monk are among NBA players who wear Bryant’s signature shoes. In the post, Bryant also said Nike would be making a signature model for Gianna Bryant, who with Kobe Bryant, died in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020. All proceeds for Gianna’s shoes, Bryant said, will support the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation. Nike will also be working with Vanessa Bryant to establish a youth basketball center in Southern California . “I know this is an inspiring moment for my husband and daughter’s global fans,” Vanessa Bryant wrote, “and I am very appreciative of each and every one of you.”

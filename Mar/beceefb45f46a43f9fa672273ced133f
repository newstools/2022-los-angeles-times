The crash occurred at 1:14 p.m., according to the Riverside County Fire Department. Of the eight people hurt, three  had moderate injuries and five  had minor injuries. “No students were in the classroom at the time of the incident due to minimum day,” according to the Val Verde Unified School District Police Department. “Unfortunately several staff members were inside the building and were injured as a result of the collision.”  A spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol, which is investigating the crash, could not be reached for comment. The driver was at the scene cooperating with investigators, according to KCBS-TV Channel 2.

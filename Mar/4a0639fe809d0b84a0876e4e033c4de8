Stanford faces top-seeded and second-ranked Arizona on Thursday in the quarterfinals. Spencer Jones made a three-pointer with 37 seconds left to pull Stanford within 70-69 and the Cardinal elected not to foul. Stanford freshman star Harrison Ingram rebounded Jalen Graham’s missed 10 footer with nine seconds left and weaved his way up court but had the ball stripped as the spun in the lane.

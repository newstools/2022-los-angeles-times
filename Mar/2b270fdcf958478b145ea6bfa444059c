Police were searching for a suspect Friday night after three people were shot at an Ontario motel, authorities said. Officers were called at 4:33 p.m. to a report of shots fired in the 1000 block of West Mission Boulevard, said Cpl. Bill Lee, an Ontario Police Department spokesman. When they got to the scene, officers found the three victims, who were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not expected to be life-threatening, Lee said. No deaths were reported. Officers searched the motel for the shooter but did not find the person, Lee said. Several people were detained to determine their potential involvement, but no one was arrested as of late Friday night. A motive for the shooting is not known and the investigation is ongoing, Lee said.

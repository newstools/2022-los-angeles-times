Three people died Monday morning in Anaheim after their car crashed into a brick wall and erupted into flames, according to police. Shortly before 2 a.m., Anaheim police  observed a Mercedes Benz speeding southbound on Harbor Boulevard. The driver lost control of the car, which went airborne as it went through the intersection of Harbor and La Palma Avenue and slammed into a brick wall on Harbor , according to Sgt. Jake Gallacher with the Anaheim Police Department. The car  split in half and then sheared a fire hydrant before catching on fire. One person was ejected from the car  and  landed in a nearby front yard. Police pulled one person out of the Mercedes and gave him CPR, but he  died at the scene, Gallacher said. Another person burned in the car. The car’s occupants were identified as Fernando Gutierrez, Juan Hernandez and Pedro Zamora Rodriguez, all 24, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. Speed was a factor in the crash, which authorities said remains under investigation.

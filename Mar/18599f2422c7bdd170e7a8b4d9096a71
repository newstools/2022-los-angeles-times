The Film Independent Spirit Awards will honor the industry’s leading indie films this afternoon, an unusual position for the ceremony which is historically held on the Saturday afternoon before the Oscars. The show is returning to an in-person event from Santa Monica after being virtual in 2021. Nominations for the 37th edition of the awards, announced by Naomi Watts, Regina Hall and Beanie Feldstein, were led by Janicza Bravo’s road trip movie “Zola.” The film had 7 noms, including best feature, director and female lead for Taylour Paige. Other best feature nominees include the psychological thriller “The Novice,” the Italian-language drama “A Chiara,” “C’mon C’mon,” about a young boy and his uncle, and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Lost Daughter.” Production budgets are the standard by which films are considered independent, and some of the Oscar-contending films that might normally fit the thematic tones of Spirit Awards nominees, including “Belfast,” “King Richard” and “The Power of the Dog,” were not eligible because they cost more than $22.5 million to make. Television, a recent addition to the awards show, will be honored with scripted and non-scripted series honors and acting prizes for the scripted shows. The 37th Film Independent Spirit Awards will be broadcast on IFC starting at 2 p.m. on March 6. The winners will be updated from the nominees list below.  “A Chiara”Producers: Jonas Carpignano, Paolo Carpignano, Jon Coplon, Ryan Zacarias “C’mon C’mon”Producers: Chelsea Barnard, Andrea Longacre-White, Lila Yacoub  “The Lost Daughter”Producers: Charles Dorfman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Osnat Handelsman Keren, Talia Kleinhendler “The Novice”Producers: Ryan Hawkins, Kari Hollend, Steven Sims, Zack Zucker “Zola”Producers: Kara Baker, Dave Franco, Elizabeth Haggard, David Hinojosa, Vince Jolivette, Christine Vachon, Gia Walsh “7 Days”Director - Roshan Sethi; Producers - Liz Cardenas, Mel Eslyn “Holler”Director - Nicole Riegel; Producers - Adam Cobb, Rachel Gould, Katie McNeill, Jamie Patricof, Christy Spitzer Thornton “Queen of Gloty”Director - Nana Mensah; Producers - Baff Akoto, Anya Migdal, Kelley Robins Hicks, Jamund Washington “Test Pattern”Director/Producer - Shatara Michelle Ford; Producers - Pin-Chun Liu, Yu-Hao Su “Wild Indian”Director/Producer - Lyle Mitchell Corbine, Jr.; Producers - Thomas Mahoney, Eric Tavitian  Janicza Bravo, “Zola”Maggie Gyllenhaal, “The Lost Daughter”Lauren Hadaway, “The Novice”Mike Mills, “C’mon C’mon”Ninja Thyberg, “Pleasure” Nikole Beckwith, “Together Together”Maggie Gyllenhaal, “The Lost Daughter”Janicza Bravo, Jeremy O.

More than 30 stolen luxury vehicles, including BMWs, Aston Martins, Bentleys, Porsches and Jaguars, were being stashed in a Van Nuys backyard, authorities said. The cars, worth a total of $2.3 million,  had been “fraudulently purchased” from dealerships in Southern California, according to California Highway Patrol investigators. An aerial photo provided by the CHP showed the cars lined up neatly on a grassy lot behind the house. Investigators discovered the cars last Thursday when they served a search warrant at the house after a two-month investigation. They also found an indoor marijuana grow operation with more than 400 plants. They seized a firearm and arrested 39-year-old Vage Chavushyan of North Hollywood on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Division III boys, 4 p.m.: Venice (21-9) vs. Chino Pleasant Valley (31-3): Two proud public schools will do battle in what should be one of the more entertaining games.

Division I girls, 6 p.m.: Windward (23-1) vs. Richmond Salesian (20-5): Windward has played against the best teams in Southern California all season and looks ready to put in a top performance behind junior guard Skye Belker and freshman center Samari Bankhead.

Open Division girls, 6 p.m.: Chatsworth Sierra Canyon (29-2) vs. San Jose Archbishop Mitty (30-1): To get past Sierra Canyon, you need to figure out how to deal with junior Juju Watkins, the Gatorade state player of the year.

Open Division boys, 8 p.m.: Corona Centennial (32-1) vs. Modesto Christian (30-5): No opponent has gotten closer than 20 points of the Huskies in more than a month.

He’s averaging 24 points for Modesto Christian.

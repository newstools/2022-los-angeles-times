Earth’s poles are undergoing simultaneous freakish extreme heat with parts of Antarctica more than 70 degrees  warmer than average and areas of the Arctic more than 50 degrees warmer than average. Weather stations in Antarctica shattered records Friday as the region neared autumn. The two-mile high Concordia station was at 10 degrees, which is about 70 degrees warmer than average, while the even higher Vostok station hit a shade above 0 degrees , beating its all-time record by about 27 degrees , according to a tweet from extreme weather record tracker Maximiliano Herrera. The coastal Terra Nova Base was far above freezing at 44.6 degrees. It caught officials at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., by surprise because they were paying attention to the Arctic, where it was 50 degrees warmer than average and areas around the North Pole were nearing or at the melting point, which is really unusual for mid-March, said center ice scientist Walt Meier.  “They are opposite seasons. You don’t see the North and the South [poles] both melting at the same time,” Meier told the Associated Press on Friday evening. “It’s definitely an unusual occurrence.” “It’s pretty stunning,” Meier added. “Wow. I have never seen anything like this in the Antarctic,” said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who returned recently from an expedition to the continent.  “Not a good sign when you see that sort of thing happen,” said University of Wisconsin meteorologist Matthew Lazzara. Lazzara monitors temperatures at East Antarctica’s Dome C-ii and logged 14 degrees  Friday, where the normal is minus 45 degrees:  “That’s a temperature that you should see in January, not March. January is summer there. That’s dramatic.” Both Lazzara and Meier said what happened in Antarctica is probably just a random weather event, not a sign of climate change. But if it happens again or repeatedly then it might be something to worry about and part of global warming, they said. The Antarctic warm spell was first reported by the Washington Post. The Antarctic continent as a whole Friday was about 8.6 degrees warmer than a baseline temperature between 1979 and 2000, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, based on U.S. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration weather models. That 8-degree heating over an already warmed-up average is unusual; think of it as if the entire United States were 8 degrees hotter than normal, Meier said. At the same time, on Friday the Arctic as a whole was 6 degrees warmer than the 1979-2000 average. By comparison, the world as a whole was only 1.1 degrees above the 1979-2000 average. Globally the 1979-2000 average is about half a degree warmer than the 20th century average. What makes the Antarctic warming really weird is that the southern continent — except for its vulnerable peninsula, which is warming quickly and losing ice rapidly — has not been warming much, especially when compared with the rest of the globe, Meier said. Antarctica did set a record for the lowest summer sea ice — records go back to 1979 — with it shrinking to 741,000 square miles in late February, the snow and ice data center reported. What likely happened was “a big atmospheric river” pumped in warm and moist air from the Pacific southward, Meier said. And in the Arctic, which has been warming two to three times faster than the rest of the globe and is considered vulnerable to climate change, warm Atlantic air was coming north off the coast of Greenland.

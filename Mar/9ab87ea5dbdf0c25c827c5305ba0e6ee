More than 100 firefighters continued to fight a growing brush fire in San Bernardino County early Monday evening.  Dubbed the Heritage fire, the blaze was initially reported in the 14700 block of Heritage Way as 3 acres in “medium-heavy fuels” with a moderate rate of spread and no threats to structures, according to the San Bernardino County Fire Protection District. A second alarm was requested, the agency stated around 1:17 p.m. By shortly before 5 p.m., the fire had grown to about 100 acres and was 0% contained, firefighters said. The blaze continued to move through a medium to heavy mix of fuels “under the influence of north winds,” firefighters said. Twenty-two fire engines, including two strike teams with structure defenses in place, were deployed.  Personnel from agencies in Victorville, Apple Valley, Loma Linda, Chino Valley, Rancho Cucamonga and Fort Irwin also responded to fight the fire, which was threatening 20 structures, San Bernardino County firefighters said.

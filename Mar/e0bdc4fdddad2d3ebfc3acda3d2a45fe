In the wake of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins’ death last week in a Bogota, Colombia, hotel room, the band has canceled all upcoming tour dates. “It is with great sadness that Foo Fighters confirm the cancellation of all upcoming tour dates in light of the staggering loss of our brother Taylor Hawkins,” the band announced in a statement. “We’re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won’t be seeing one another as planned. Instead, let’s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we’ve made together.” They signed it, “With Love, Foo Fighters.” The tour cancellation comes after the Colombian attorney general’s office released a statement that a forensic medical examination and urine toxicology report that found that Hawkins, 50, had 10 substances in his system at the time of death including THC (marijuana), benzodiazepines and opioids.  Dave Grohl and Foo Fighters had a packed schedule of concerts scheduled for 2022. Beginning in late April, they had more than 50 dates planned across the U.S. before heading to Europe for summer shows. The group was scheduled to perform at this Sunday’s Grammy Awards in Las Vegas. Hawkins played his final concert during Foo Fighters’ headlining slot at Lollapalooza Argentina on March 20. Before his death, he was scheduled to perform with the band at Lollapalooza Brazil.

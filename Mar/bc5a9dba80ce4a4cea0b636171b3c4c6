Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, officials said. Harris’ spokesperson, Sabrina Singh, confirmed in a statement that Emhoff tested positive earlier in the day. The vice president tested negative but would continue to test and would skip a White House event on gender equity Tuesday afternoon “out of an abundance of caution,” Singh said. A White House official said Harris was last with the second gentleman on Tuesday morning. She attended two subsequent meetings with President Biden — a morning intelligence briefing and an early afternoon bill signing, according to her schedule. Biden, 79, is fully vaccinated, but older people face greater risk of serious illness from the disease. The White House recently relaxed masking requirements, and Harris was seen in a close huddle with Biden and congressional leaders as the president signed the $1.5-trillion spending bill Tuesday afternoon. None of the officials was wearing a mask. Among the officials were House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat, and Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who serves as president pro tempore of the Senate. They are the second and third in the line of presidential succession after Harris. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, was also in attendance for the signing.

Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and to paraphrase Richard Nixon, you won’t have Kenley Jansen to kick around anymore. Jansen, the best closer in Dodgers history, signed a one-year, $16-million deal with the Atlanta Braves. According to Jorge Castillo’s excellent story, the Dodgers were one of the few teams willing to offer Jansen two years, but, after signing Freddie Freeman, “the Dodgers wanted Jansen to wait until they shed payroll before signing to keep their payroll under $290 million and avoid the resulting 90% tax rate for exceeding the competitive balance tax line for the second straight season.” So, rather than wait for the Dodgers to get their payroll in order, Jansen took the one-year deal the Braves were offering. “I started to feel that the Dodgers had to make stuff happen,” Jansen said. “And, at the same time, you got to deal with the reality of what’s best for you and your family.” Jansen grew up a Braves fan.  Jansen fell out of favor with some Dodgers fans the last couple of years. His last elite-level year was in 2017, when he had 41 saves, a 1.32 ERA and gave up only 44 hits and seven walks in 68 1/3  innings while striking out 109. He finished fifth in Cy Young voting. His numbers declined some since then, but only look bad in comparison to his previous years. He lost his closer role during the 2020 playoffs, but regained it last season and, with the exception of a brief meltdown during the season against the Giants (the last team you want to melt down against if you are with the Dodgers), he was solid last season. Yet the reaction by many on social media has been to cheer the fact he is no longer a Dodger, which is a ridiculous attitude to take. The fact is  the Dodgers wouldn’t have been as successful as they have been in recent years without Jansen. And though at times people (including the guy who writes this newsletter) called for him to be demoted out of the closer role, now is not the time to gloat. Now is the time to reflect back on a tremendous Dodger career. When Jansen returns to Dodger Stadium this season, he deserves nothing less than a lengthy standing ovation. And you never know. It’s only a one-year deal. Who knows where he might sign in 2023. The Dodgers? Anything is possible. So who is the Dodgers’ new closer? Dave Roberts says he has no plans to  name a closer, going with more of a closer by committee. However, you would have to expect Blake Treinen would get the majority of save opportunities. Let’s take a look at where Jansen ranks on the Dodgers’ leaderboard.

Remember, just because no charges were filed against Bauer does not mean he can’t be suspended. They were unable to talk to Bauer while the lockout was on. You would have to figure some sort of decision is coming soon. We want to hear from you. Do you think Trevor Bauer should pitch again for the Dodgers? Click here to vote. The Dodgers signed free-agent pitchers Danny Duffy and Tyler Anderson. Duffy was acquired before the trade deadline last season, but never pitched for the Dodgers because his elbow injury was more severe than anticipated. He gets $3 million this year, with an option to receive $7 million in 2023. He won’t be available to pitch until June because of the injury. Anderson signed a one-year, $8-million deal. He is left-handed and had a 4.53 ERA in 31 starts last season with Pittsburgh and Seattle. He has been a league-average pitcher in his career, with a career ERA+ of 100.  The Dodgers traded outfielder Luke Raley to the Tampa Bay Rays for pitching prospect Tanner Dodson. Raley hit .182/.250/.288 for the Dodgers last season, striking out 25 times in 66 at-bats. Dodson is a 24-year-old right-hander who had a 4.86 ERA in double-A Montgomery last season. The Dodgers also put infielder Sheldon Neuse on waivers and he was claimed by Oakland. Neuse hit  .169/.182/.323 for the Dodgers last season in 33 games.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer, concluded her two days of questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. After the hearings conclude with outside witness testimony Thursday, the committee will vote next week on sending her nomination to the full Senate. Democrats hope to confirm Jackson by April 8, when they leave Washington for a two-week spring recess.

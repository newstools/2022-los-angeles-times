For many, the Los Angeles Marathon represents a showcase of athletic prowess and a rare moment of collective unity. Others see it as an annual traffic jam. The 37th annual L.A. Marathon will take place Sunday and  include roughly 15,000 runners from around the country — and the world —  covering a 26.2-mile course that spans some of L.A.'s most iconic neighborhoods. The 2022 route mirror’s the previous year’s to a tee — including a twist at the end that departs from recent races (prior to 2021). Runners will begin at Dodger Stadium, turn toward downtown and sail under the Chinatown Dragon Gate, past Olvera Street, and through Little Tokyo before turning northwest past Echo Park Lake and into Hollywood. Wheelchair participants will start at 6:30 a.m., followed by elite women runners at 6:45 a.m., and elite men at 6:55 a.m. The race continues through Beverly Hills — with a view of tony Rodeo Drive — into West. L.A. Runners will then double back on San Vicente, Sepulveda and Santa Monica boulevards before finishing at Avenue of the Stars.  Dozens of roads and freeway ramps will close to make way for the runners. Several large thoroughfares will temporarily close for the race. Freeway ramps for  northbound and southbound lanes of the 110 and 101 freeways, as well as southbound 405 Freeway, will be affected at different times during the race. Ramp closures will include:  For the full list of road and freeway closures, click here and download the tables.

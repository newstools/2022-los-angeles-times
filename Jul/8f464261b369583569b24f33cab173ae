Authorities are searching for a man believed to be connected to four armed robberies of convenience stores and doughnut shops in the San Fernando Valley, police said Tuesday. The robberies occurred over roughly 1½ hours early Saturday in North Hills, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The first robbery occurred at 3:55 a.m. in the 16000 block of Parthenia Street, the second at 4:30 a.m. in the 16000 block of Nordhoff Street, the third at 4:50 a.m. in the 16000 block of Devonshire Street and the fourth at 5:30 a.m. in the 16000 block of San Fernando Mission Boulevard, police said. Cash was taken in each robbery. “According to video surveillance and witness statements, the suspect is described as a male, Black, between 25 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 10 inches tall, and between 160 to 180 pounds,” the LAPD said in a news release. “The suspect was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, a black face covering, and dark jeans.” During each robbery, the suspect brandished a black, semiautomatic handgun and demanded money from a store employee, police said. No one was hurt or injured in any of the robberies. Investigators have not connected the North Hills robberies to a broader series of armed robberies and shootings, two of which were fatal, at 7-Eleven stores across Southern California, but they are not ruling out the possibility the incidents are related, said Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton.

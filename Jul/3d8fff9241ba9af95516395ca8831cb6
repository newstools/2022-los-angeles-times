After a standoff with authorities  early  Monday, a man was arrested on suspicion of fatally shooting his roommate  at the apartment  they shared in Irvine. Police received a 911 text around 2:19 a.m.  from a man who said he had heard two of his roommates arguing followed by gunshots, the Irvine Police Department said in a social media post. Police said they entered the residence and found one man dead from gunshot wounds and the suspect, David Bohr, 39, at the top of the stairs with a gun pointed to his head. Officers began talking to Bohr, who initially refused to surrender, police  said. The Irvine Police Department’s SWAT  and crisis negotiations teams arrived to assist in the standoff. Crisis negotiators encouraged Bohr to peacefully surrender as the SWAT team and members of the Orange County Fire Authority rescued two other roommates from the building, police said. One of the other roommates was able to climb out of a second-story balcony and onto the roof of the building, where SWAT team members were standing, drone video captured by the  police  shows. Bohr was taken into custody at 5:09 a.m. and taken to the Orange County Jail in Santa Ana, according to authorities. The shooting took place at an apartment in the Irvine Groves residential community off  Walnut Avenue. Four men who were roommates lived there, including a man who initially contacted police and continued to text updates to authorities while he was locked in his room. Police have withheld the victim’s identity pending the notification of his next of kin. Police said they are still investigating the events leading up to the death.

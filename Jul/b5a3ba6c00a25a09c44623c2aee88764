A gunman was arrested  Thursday morning after apparently opening fire at  Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies who had him surrounded  as the apartment he was hiding in was engulfed in flames, officials said. Shortly after 7:15 a.m., deputies responded to a  call at an apartment complex in the 100 block of Acacia Avenue in Compton, where they found a man with a gunshot wound and determined that another man was hiding inside an apartment with a firearm, officials said. The man in  the apartment opened fire on the deputies with a shotgun, officials said. With a special weapons team from the Sheriff’s Department’s special enforcement bureau and  two armored vehicles surrounding the apartment, negotiators ordered the man to come out unarmed. The suspect was arrested and taken to a hospital,   Deputy Miguel Meza said. During  negotiations with the gunman, deputies evacuated the apartment complex as a portion of it was engulfed in fire, officials said. Officials turned off the gas to the building, fearing an explosion. In one dramatic moment caught by TV news cameras, deputies used ladders  to evacuate a woman through a window of an apartment. The alleged shooter, with  deputies in body armor on the complex balcony, came out unarmed and lay  on the ground and was immediately handcuffed. After the gunman was detained, Compton firefighters began tackling the fire as smoke continued to billow  from the complex. The cause  of the blaze was unclear. The wounded man, whom Maza said was the victim of an accidental discharge inside the apartment, was taken to a hospital.

The X Games kicked off the first day of high-flying competitions Wednesday with skateboard vert, skateboard vert best trick, BMX megapark and skateboard megapark. The events were held at the Sloanyard, a private skateboard compound at the home of skateboarder Elliot Sloan in Vista. The morning session of skateboard vert and vert best trick was held on a 100-foot wide, 14-foot tall (at its lowest part) halfpipe that includes a 20-foot roll-in. Jimmy Wilkins of Cardiff won the skateboard vert competition and Elliot Sloan won the  trick competition with a heel flip 720. The afternoon events were held on a wood megapark, which included a 35-foot-high roll-in to soar across a 34-foot gap into a 20-foot tall quarterpipe. Ryan Willams from Australia won the BMX megapark and Edouard Damestoy of France won the skateboard division. Other X Games events in San Diego this weekend include motorcross freestyle, best whip, quarterpipe high air and BMX dirt, street, park and trick.

Three people were killed and four others injured when their speeding vehicle crashed, rolled over and burst into flames in Orange early Saturday, police reported. A Nissan Altima traveling south at high speed on North Glassell Street about 2:45 a.m. failed to negotiate a curve at North Orange Olive Road and crashed, Orange police said. The Nissan rolled over and all seven occupants were ejected, police said. Three  died at the scene and the  others were taken to local hospitals — three in critical condition and one with moderate injuries, authorities said. Orange police said that drugs and alcohol are suspected as a factor in the crash. KABC-TV Channel 7 reported that two of the  critically injured are juveniles. Sgt.

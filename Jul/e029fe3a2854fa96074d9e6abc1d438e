The Pasadena Police Department placed Caltech and Pasadena City College under lockdown for just over an hour Thursday afternoon, the universities tweeted. The campuses were under a shared lockdown order as officers worked to apprehend “robbery suspects in the vicinity,” according to a tweet by Caltech at 4:03 p.m. “If not on campus, do not come to campus,” the tweet said. “If on campus, please remain in place until you receive a release of the lockdown order.” Pasadena City College officials tweeted a similar alert at 3:43 p.m. calling for anyone on campus to “lock doors and shelter in place until further notice.” At 5:12 p.m., Pasadena City College tweeted that the lockdown was lifted. “There is no longer a threat to the campus community,” the tweet said. Pasadena police did not immediately respond to a request for information.

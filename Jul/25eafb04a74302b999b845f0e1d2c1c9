Two firefighters were injured by falling debris Thursday morning when a burning building in South L.A. collapsed, according to officials. Firefighters responded to the fire about 5:35 a.m. at a 3,600-square-foot building in the  500 block of West Manchester Avenue, according to a Los Angeles Fire Department  release. The building eventually collapsed, injuring the two firefighters, officials said. Their injuries were minor, but both firefighters were taken to a hospital to be evaluated. It took several dozen firefighters less than an hour to extinguish the blaze, officials said. The cause of the fire is  under investigation.

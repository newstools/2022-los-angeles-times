Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and I began my vacation July 1. The Dodgers were 47-28, 2½ games up on San Diego. I’m back today. The Dodgers went 9-1 while I was off and are now 7 1/2 games ahead of  San Diego. Which means I should take the rest of the season off. See you in October! OK, turns out my bosses won’t go for that. So let’s catch up. The Dodgers are playing remarkably well right now, and it seems as if they should play like this all the time. It’s  why some fans get so frustrated when the team has a poor stretch of games. If a team wins six out of every 10 games,  it will win about 97 games during a season. Going 6-4 doesn’t sound like much, but if you do that all season, you will make the playoffs. Let’s break the Dodgers’ record into 10-game segments. Games 1-10: 8-2. Overall record: 8-211-20: 5-5. Overall: 13-721-30: 7-3. Overall: 20-1031-40: 7-3. Overall: 27-1341-50: 6-4. Overall: 33-1751-60: 4-6. Overall: 37-2361-70: 7-3. Overall: 44-2671-80: 7-3. Overall: 51-2981-86: 5-0. Overall: 56-29 Looking at it this way, the Dodgers have really had only one bad stretch, when they went 4-6 over a 10-game period. The New York Yankees, who have the best record in baseball, have had two stretches in which they went 5-5.  They are on pace to win 115 games, while the  Dodgers are on pace to win 107.  Barring unforeseen circumstances, it would be very surprising if we don’t have a Dodgers-Yankees World Series. The Dodgers have five games before the All-Star break. Three at St. Louis and two at the Angels. They are guaranteed to be in first when the break begins. The Dodgers will send four players to the All-Star Game: Trea Turner and Mookie Betts will be in the starting lineup, and Clayton Kershaw and Tony Gonsolin will be on the pitching staff. You could make a case for Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, Tyler Anderson and Julio Urías as well. But the “at least one player from each team” rule hurts at times like this. Colorado’s lone representative is C.J. Cron, who plays first base. Freeman is hitting .304/.381/.494/142 OPS+. Cron is hitting .295/.350/.551/138 OPS+. Cron has better power numbers, but he plays at Coors Field, so his OPS+ is lower. Both are good players, but would Freeman have made it if the Rockies didn’t need a representative?  There are three catchers on the team: Willson Contreras of the Cubs, William Contreras of the Braves and Travis d’Arnaud of the Braves. And while it’s cute that the Contreras brothers get to play on the same All-Star team, the fact is Smith should have made it over one of the Braves catchers. Contreras has half the plate appearances Smith has, and Smith is a better hitter than d’Arnaud. Anderson and Urías still could be named later this week. If a starting pitcher on the NL team pitches Sunday, he would be replaced on the All-Star team.  And injuries could pop up to open a spot, but no one wants to see an injury. All-Star debates. Part of the fun of every  season. A big topic  among Dodgers fans has been who should start for the NL, Kershaw or Gonsolin? This assumes of course that the decision comes down to those two and all the other pitchers on the squad aren’t considered. Do you go with Kershaw, who is not having as good a season as Gonsolin but is the greatest pitcher of his generation and is a sentimental choice to start the first All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium since 1980? Or do you go with Gonsolin, who is having one of the best first halves in baseball history? Click here to vote in our informal survey and let us know what you think.  Dodger fans of a certain age will remember the man in the Panama hat who stood in the dugout seats behind home plate every game, cigar in mouth, radar gun in hand. That was Mike Brito, the scout who discovered Fernando Valenzuela, among others. Brito, 87, died Thursday. “My heart is very heavy today,” Valenzuela said in a statement released by the team. “Mike was a great man and instrumental in my success as a baseball player on and off the field. No one loved the Dodger organization more than Mike and we will all miss him very much. My prayers go out to his wife, Rosario, and all of his family and friends.” Brito also helped sign Bobby Castillo, Ismael Valdez, Antonio Osuna, Juan Castro, Dennys Reyes, Yasiel Puig and Julio Urías. “He impacted the Dodgers organization for decades,” manager Dave Roberts said. “I learned a lot from him, talking about players and just seeing the game. And it doesn’t matter where on the map there was a baseball game. If there was a potential prospect, Mike was willing to be there and put his eyes on him.”  Dodger Stadium concession workers could go on strike at any time after 99% of the food and beverage workers at the stadium voted to authorize such an action. The workers seek “a fair new union contract,” a  statement said. “They are the backbone of our tourism and sports industry, yet many struggle to stay housed and to make ends meet,” said Susan Minato, co-president of Unite Here Local 11. “They often live with economic uncertainty because the quality of jobs vary stadium to stadium. No worker should have to continue living like this.” Learn more in this story by Bill Shaikin.

Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and the Dodgers have three players in the top 10 in NL batting averages. The Dodgers have been on a pretty good hot streak the last couple of weeks, but that doesn’t stop some fans from gnashing their teeth and wearing sackcloth and ashes after each loss. Lately, the growing consensus is that the Dodgers can’t possibly win the World Series with two guys hitting below .220. This, of course, ignores the fact that the Dodgers won the World Series in 2020 with two guys hitting below .200.  The tendency among many fans is to treat their team as if it exists in a vacuum. The focus is on the Dodgers’ flaws, forgetting that every teams has flaws. The Dodgers are going to make the playoffs and then anything can happen. But are the Dodgers really at a disadvantage having two players (Max Muncy, .161, and Cody Bellinger, .212) hitting below .220? Let’s take a look at the three worst batting averages/OPS+ combinations for players who get a lot of playing time for  potential playoff teams. DodgersMax Muncy, .158/.317/.303, 77 OPS+Cody Bellinger, .210/.271/.380, 80 OPS+Chris Taylor, .238/.319/.409, 101 OPS+ MetsTomás Nido, .211/.256/.236, 42 OPS+Eduardo Escobar, .217/..273/.387, 86 OPS+J.D. Davis, .240/.328/.353, 95 OPS+ BravesAdam Duvall, .204/.269/.383, 78 OPS+Orlando Arcia, .248/.324/.360, 89 OPS+Marcell Ozuna, .226/.282/.418, 90 OPS+ PhilliesBryson Stott, .187/.256/.301, 58 OPS+Didi Gregorius, .236/.298/.339, 82 OPS+Odubel Herrera, .240/.280/.392, 89 OPS+ BrewersLuis Urias, .223/.315/.391, 99 OPS+Kolten Wong, .227/.314/.391, 99 OPS+Tyrone Taylor, .228/.277/.423, 95 OPS+ CardinalsAndrew Knizner, .205/.297/.260, 65 OPS+Tyler O’Neill, .235/.286/.353, 84 OPS+Harrison Bader, .256/.303/.370, 93 OPS+ PadresTrent Grisham, .190/.293/.324, 81 OPS+C.J. Abrams, .233/.278/.328, 77 OPS+Austin Nola, .236/.306/.300, 79 OPS+ GiantsJoey Bart, .168/.299/.327, 76 OPS+Brandon Crawford, .218/.303/.339, 80 OPS+Darin Ruf, .226/.337/.353, 95 OPS+ And the two best AL teams: Yankees Joey Gallo, .166/.287/.336, 80 OPS+Josh Donaldson, .225/.310/.395, 102 OPS+Aaron Hicks, .237/.356/.357, 107 OPS+ AstrosMartin Maldonado, .165/.236/.325, 59 OPS+Jose Siri, .185/.248/.315, 60 OPS+Yuli Gurriel, .230/.283/.385, 89 OPS+ So, if you look at the Dodgers in a vacuum, they look like they are in trouble with three below average hitters in the lineup. But if you compare them to the other teams, they don’t look as bad. In fact, some of those teams would gladly welcome Max Muncy into their lineup as an improvement.  That’s not to say we should be rejoicing. No, there’s obvious room for improvement. But those three hitters don’t put the Dodgers at a marked disadvantage. Brusdar Graterol went on the 15-day IL on Thursday because of right shoulder inflammation. The Dodgers brought Reyes Moronta up from the minors to take his place. There isn’t too much concern over Graterol, and he was put on the IL to take advantage of the All-Star break. “Just kind of given the workload for the first half,” Dave Roberts said. “You’ve got three days to backdate, you’ve got four days over the break, so the cost isn’t that much.” Freddie Freeman has 13 hits in his last 16 at-bats, one short of the L.A. Dodger record for most hits over a four-game period. A look: Rafael Furcal, 2007, 14 for 18Shawn Green, 2002, 13 for 19Mike Piazza, 1995, 13 for 20Jim Wynn, 1974, 13 for 18Ted Sizemore, 1970, 13 for 19 The all-time Dodger record is 16 hits in a four-game period by Milt Stock in 1925. He did it in 23 at-bats.  You were asked to vote in our informal survey asking “Who should start the All-Star game, Tony Gonsolin or Clayton Kershaw? After16,072 votes, here are the results: Clayton Kershaw, 76.3%Tony Gonsolin, 23.7%  One of the more popular Dodger-related promotions  is the pins that 76 gas stations give away each summer with a purchase. I can remember collecting Dodger-related items from 76 when I was a kid, so I always look forward to this promotion. I get no kick backs for this, it’s just a reminder of a fond childhood memory. This year, they are giving away two pins to people who use the My 76 App to buy at least eight gallons of gas between July 15-Aug. 31. And with the price of gas currently, that means you can get two pins for around $3,000. You can see the pins in the picture above. Who are the best and worst pitchers ranked by ERA+ in Dodgers history? Here’s the top and bottom 10. ERA+ allows us to compare ERA’s across time periods. An ERA+ of 90 means you were 10% worse than an average pitcher in your period. An ERA+ of 110 means you were 10% better. And so on. Minimum 350 innings.

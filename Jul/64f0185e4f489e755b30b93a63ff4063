The nominations for the 2022 Emmys are out! JB Smoove (“Curb Your Enthusiasm”) and Melissa Fumero (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) announced several top categories Tuesday  morning, loaded with the usual smart-money picks, snubs and surprises. Past champions “Succession” and “Ted Lasso” ruled the roost with 25 and 20 nominations, respectively. “Succession” had a jaw-dropping 14 actors selected. And while “Better Call Saul” fans are still biting their nails over the fate of favorite character Kim Wexler, the actress who plays her, Rhea Seehorn, finally received her first nomination in the show’s final season. “The White Lotus” was the most-honored limited series, with 20 nods, followed by “Dopesick” with 14, and dominated the limited-series supporting acting categories with eight performers recognized — including five supporting actresses. Newcomers “Only Murders in the Building” (17 nominations), “Severance” (14), “Squid Game” (14), “Abbott Elementary” (7) and “Yellowjackets” (7) also had strong showings. “Squid Game” became the first non-English-language program to earn a major Emmy nomination. The 74th Emmy Awards ceremony is scheduled to air  Sept. 12 on NBC and Peacock. Neither the host nor the venue has  yet been announced.

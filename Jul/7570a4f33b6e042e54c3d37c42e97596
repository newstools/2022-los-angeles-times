Hotter temperatures, lower humidity and strong winds starting Friday will increase the risk for wildfires in Los Angeles County’s inland, valley and mountain areas, according to the National Weather Service. Wind gusts are expected to reach 40 to 45 mph in the western San Gabriel Mountains  from the Tejon Pass to Lake Hughes, according to the National Weather Service. The agency issued a red flag warning for critical fire conditions across the region starting at 1 p.m. Friday  through 6 a.m. on Saturday. “People in SoCal who live in the valleys, foothills and mountains need to be on alert that if something could start and spread quickly it could impact them,” said weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson. Strong winds will dry out vegetation and drive down the humidity — to between 6% and 12% — in these areas, officials said. Temperatures will range from the 90s to around 105 degrees on Friday and Saturday in  lower mountain elevations and across the Antelope Valley. Temperatures along the coast and a large swath of Los Angeles will remain in the  70s Friday. Thompson said people should be aware of ignition sources, including loose sparks from welding equipment and other machinery,   unattended campfires and unsecured  items that could be dragged from a vehicle and generate sparks. Having a “go-bag” ready  with all the  essentials in case a fire threatens  homes is also a good idea, Thompson said. “We always say, ‘Ready, set, go,’ in case a fire does develop. Have that bag just so you’re ready to go,” he said. The winds are expected to die down by late Saturday morning, with  slightly cooler temperatures  and chances for monsoonal moisture starting in the deserts and mountains Sunday.

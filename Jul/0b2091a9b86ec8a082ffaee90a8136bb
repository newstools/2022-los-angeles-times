Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell, and the sprint to the playoffs begins tonight. Some random thoughts before we look back at the first half and forward to the second half. —The All-Star Game needs to go back to players wearing their team’s uniform. You should be able to turn on the game and identify who is on the field immediately. These generic uniforms are just a money grab. When the Avengers get together, they don’t wear the same uniform. Captain America dresses like Captain America. Thor like Thor. It’s what superheroes do, and you still want kids out there to think of their favorites as superheroes. —Tyler Kepner of the New York Times asked baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred about it and here’s his response: “I never thought that a baseball team wearing different jerseys in a game was a particularly appealing look for us.” —Which is more evidence to my theory that Manfred is the only sports commissioner in history who actually dislikes the sport they are in charge of.  —Very smart of Tony Gonsolin to get his first loss of the season in a game that doesn’t mean anything. —The compulsive worrier in me sees Gonsolin have a poor outing in his last start, then sees him get lit up in the All-Star Game, and wonders if a serious regression is in store for the second half.  —It was great to see two superstars, Clayton Kershaw and Albert Pujols, treated like kings for a day. The first half is over. Let’s take a look at some stats. Best record in baseball 1. New York Yankees, 64-282. Dodgers, 60-303. Houston Asterisks, 59-324. New York Mets, 58-355.

They are at or near the top of most categories. They have 41 games  left against teams with a winning record and 31 against a team with a losing record. They are going to win the division. And after that, well, anyone who tells you they know the Dodgers will win or lose the World Series is bluffing. Anything can happen.  It seemed appropriate that the All-Star Game this year, at Dodger Stadium, would fall on the 100th birthday of Rachel Robinson, wife of Dodger legend Jackie Robinson. Mookie Betts made sure everyone knew when he said before the game: “I know this is the 2022 All-Star Game, but today is a special day. It’s Miss Rachel Robinson’s 100th birthday. So on the count of three, I want everybody in here to say, ‘Happy birthday, Rachel.’” After the first inning, Rachel Robinson received a video tribute on the Dodgervision board. After Jackie died in 1972, Rachel took charge of his foundation, which has provided college scholarships to close to 1,500 people. Actress Octavia Spencer narrated the video, and concluded with this: “His trial was her trial. His pain was her pain. In 1948, Jackie called her, ‘The most important and helpful and encouraging person I’ve ever known in my life.’ When Rachel was asked about Jack’s legacy, she recalled his words that are etched into his statue, ‘A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives.’ She’s a reminder of how far we have traveled and how far we have yet to go. She defines the power of ‘we.’ We are better because of Rachel Robinson.”  Thursday: San Francisco (Carlos Rodón, 8-5, 2.66 ERA) at Dodgers (*Mitch White, 1-2, 4.20 ERA), 7 p.m., SportsNet LA, AM 570, KTNQ 1020 Friday: San Francisco (Logan Webb, 9-3, 2.83 ERA) at Dodgers (TBD), 7 p.m., SportsNet LA, AM 570, KTNQ 1020 Saturday: San Francisco (*Alex Wood, 6-7, 4.20 ERA) at Dodgers (TBD), 4:15 p.m., Fox, AM 570, KTNQ 1020 Sunday: San Francisco (Alex Cobb, 3-4, 4.09 ERA) at Dodgers (TBD), 1 p.m., SportsNet LA, AM 570, KTNQ 1020 *-left-handed Clayton Kershaw makes most of All-Star moment on a night dedicated to Dodgers greats Photos: Baseball’s best shine on MLB All-Star Game red carpet Elliott: MLB All-Star Game provides a fun, big-league escape for players and fans Plaschke: Baseball’s stars come out to shine in glittering showcase at Dodger Stadium Hernández: Shohei Ohtani and Clayton Kershaw don’t hold back in memorable All-Star duel Dodgers’ Mookie Betts embraces his activist side for Black inclusion during All-Star Game Commentary: All-Star Game is jewel but World Series is real gem Dodgers broadcaster Joe Davis comfortable as ‘the voice of baseball’ at Fox  Watch the All-Stars get introduced before the game.

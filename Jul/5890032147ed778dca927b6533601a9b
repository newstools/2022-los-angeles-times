The House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack has subpoenaed the Secret Service for text messages agents reportedly deleted around Jan. 6, 2021. Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said in a statement that the committee is seeking “the relevant text messages, as well as any after action reports that have been issued in any and all divisions of the USSS pertaining or relating in any way to the events of January 6, 2021.” The subpoenas were issued Friday night, hours after the nine-member panel received a closed briefing from the watchdog for the Department of Homeland Security. The committee had originally sought the electronic records in mid-January and made an official request in March for all communications received or sent from DHS employees between Jan. 5 and Jan. 7, 2021.  DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari on Friday briefed the House committee about his finding that the Secret Service deleted texts from around Jan. 6, according to two people familiar with the matter.  While lawmakers were tight-lipped about what they heard, the closed-door briefing came two days after Cuffari’s office sent a letter to leaders of the House and Senate Homeland Security committees stating that Secret Service agents erased messages between Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2021, “as part of a device-replacement program.” The deletion came after the watchdog office requested records from the agents as part of its probe into events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack, the letter said. For the panel, the watchdog’s finding raised the startling prospect of lost evidence that could shed further light on Donald Trump’s actions during the insurrection. Thompson told the Associated Press on Friday that the committee is taking a deeper look at whether records may have been lost. “There have been some conflicting positions on the matter,” the lawmaker said.  The Secret Service insists that proper procedures were followed.  “The insinuation that the Secret Service maliciously deleted text messages following a request is false,” agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. “In fact, the Secret Service has been fully cooperating with the [office of the inspector general] in every respect — whether it be interviews, documents, emails or texts.” He said the Secret Service had started to reset its mobile devices to factory settings in January 2021 “as part of a preplanned, three-month system migration.” In that process, some data were lost. The inspector general first requested the electronic communications Feb. 26, 2021, “after the migration was well under way,” Guglielmi said. The Secret Service said it has provided the inspector general with a substantial number of emails and chat messages that include conversations and details related to Jan. 6. It also said text messages from the Capitol Police requesting assistance on Jan. 6 were preserved and provided to the inspector general’s office. The Senate Homeland committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service, is also expecting a briefing from the inspector general about the letter, according to a person familiar with the committee’s discussions who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. The Jan. 6 committee has taken a renewed interest in the Secret Service following the dramatic testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who recalled what she heard about Trump’s actions the day of the insurrection. Hutchinson recalled being told about a confrontation between Trump and his Secret Service detail as he angrily demanded to be driven to the Capitol, where his supporters would later breach the building. She also recalled overhearing Trump telling security officials to remove magnetometers for his rally on the Ellipse, even though some of his supporters were armed. Some details of that account were quickly disputed by those agents. Robert Engel, the agent who was driving the presidential SUV, and Trump security official Tony Ornato are willing to testify under oath that no agent was assaulted and that Trump never lunged for the steering wheel, a person familiar with the matter told the AP. The person would not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. With evidence still emerging, the House Jan. 6 committee has scheduled its next hearing for Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. The hearing, the eighth in a series that began in early June, will take a deeper look into the three-hour-plus stretch during which Trump failed to act as a mob of supporters stormed the Capitol. It will be the first Jan. 6 hearing to be televised in prime time since the initial broadcast June 9, which was viewed by 20 million people.

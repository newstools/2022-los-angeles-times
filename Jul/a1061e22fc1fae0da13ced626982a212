Justin Bieber will resume his “Justice” world tour on July 31 after contracting a virus that left his face partially paralyzed, a representative for the singer told Variety on Tuesday. According to his website, the “Ghost” hitmaker will return to the stage at the Summer music festival in Lucca, Italy, before traveling to Denmark, Sweden, Norway and other locations in Europe, South America, Asia, Africa and Australia. No North American tour dates are currently listed on the itinerary. Team Bieber did not immediately respond Tuesday to The Times’ requests for confirmation. Last month, the Grammy winner postponed his remaining North American tour dates after developing Ramsay Hunt syndrome — defined by the Mayo Clinic as a shingles outbreak that occurs in people who have had chickenpox and affects the nerve near one ear, causing one-sided paralysis and hearing loss. “I wanted to update you guys on what’s been going on,” Bieber said in an Instagram video posted in June. “As you can see from my face, I have this syndrome called Ramsay Hunt syndrome ... This eye is not blinking. I can’t smile in this side of my face. This nostril will not move. ... So there’s full paralysis on this side of my face.”   Directly addressing fans who were “frustrated” by the canceled shows, the “Justice” artist explained he was “just physically, obviously not capable of doing them” and interpreted the illness as his body telling him to “slow down.” “I love you guys. Thanks for being patient with me,” he added. “It’s gonna be OK, and I have hope. I trust God and I trust that this is all for a reason and I’m not sure what that is right now, but in the meantime, I’m gonna rest and I love you guys.”

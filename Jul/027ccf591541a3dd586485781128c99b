 Mckenzie Trahan had lived on the streets of Hollywood on and off since she was 13. At 22, she was nearly seven months pregnant and staying in a tent in the dirt above the 101 Freeway.  “Stitches,” to her friends — or as her scalp tattoo put it, one of “Hollywood’s Finest” — would struggle to find and keep a home to raise her baby.

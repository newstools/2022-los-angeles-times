A brush fire burned almost 5 acres in the Arroyo Seco area of Highland Park before firefighters contained the blaze Friday night. The fire started in medium to heavy brush near 368 S. Ave. 60, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in an alert shortly before 10 p.m. Videos posted to Twitter by motorists showed flames and billowing smoke approaching the 110 Freeway. Horse stables were nearby, one user said.   Nearly 100 LAFD firefighters battled the blaze, reaching containment in about an hour and 15 minutes, according to the Fire Department. TV news footage showed most of the flames extinguished shortly after 11 p.m. Firefighters will continue to bolster containment lines and put out any hot spots or smoldering debris, the LAFD said. No injuries were reported. Gold Line service between Highland Park and South Pasadena was shut down and replaced with shuttle buses because the fire was burning close to the tracks, the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

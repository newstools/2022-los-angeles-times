With eight returning starters and several highly regarded transfers, St. Francis could be a team to reckon with this fall in high school football. Quarterback Jack Jacobs, who stands 6 feet 6, finally has a solid group of receivers, plus a talented offensive line led by Division I prospects Racin Delgatty (6-4, 305 pounds) and Phillip Ocon (6-4, 320 pounds). Tight end Preston Jernegan will also help. The best newcomer is running back Devyn Turner, a transfer from Allen High in Texas. He’s fast and strong. Coach Dean Herrington also likes his kicker, Clint Geryak, a top pole vaulter. The challenge for St. Francis will be seeing how the defense performs with eight new starters.

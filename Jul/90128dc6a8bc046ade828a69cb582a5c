Hector Ceballos catches passes. Not just a few passes. A lot. In one game last season, he made 27 receptions, setting a City Section record at Franklin High. He’s back for his senior season after catching 111 passes for 1,504 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2021. Now coach Narciso Diaz must pick a quarterback to get him the ball. There are three quarterbacks competing for the starting job this summer. Sophomore Eduardo Cuevas is a basketball player playing football for the first time. He helped Franklin reach the semifinals of the Arroyo tournament. Junior Johnathan Velasquez was the junior varsity  quarterback last season. Senior Christian Adame is so big he could play tight end or linebacker. With 14 returning starters, Franklin is part of a very competitive Northern League that  also includes very competitive  teams in Eagle Rock and Lincoln. Franklin returns All-City defensive back Benjamin Villareal, who started all 11 games as a sophomore. Two veteran offensive linemen also return in Sebastian Pascuzzo and John Paul Hernandez. It will be interesting to see if teams can better handle  Ceballos for another season.

Contrary to social media rumors, Drake was not arrested in Sweden Thursday night. As seen on now-expired Instagram Stories, the “Honestly, Nevermind” artist flew into Sweden Wednesday on his private jet — dubbed Air Drake — for unknown reasons. The next day, Drake shared photos from  his hotel room. Fans on the internet had speculated that he was arrested in a Stockholm nightclub by  police Thursday. The artist’s team, however, denied that,  telling  the Hollywood Reporter  that the rapper-singer was home safe in his hotel at the time.  Drake hasn’t yet commented on the rumor. The alleged arrest caused “Free Drake” to trend on Twitter, with several calling for his release and joking how he was spending his time in Swedish jail. “Drake getting arrested in Sweden may be the most random thing I heard all day lmao,” one user wrote. It wouldn’t have been the first time one of  music’s biggest artists was detained in Sweden. In July 2019, ASAP Rocky was arrested and detained in Sweden after police said he and his entourage assaulted a man. The “Testing” rapper had claimed two men were following him down the street and being loudly confrontational before they attacked him and forced Rocky and company to act in self-defense. Rocky   was found guilty of assault in August 2019 and given a two-year suspended sentence, allowing him to come home that same month. The incident became an international matter after former President Trump tried to intervene — although Rocky later revealed he feared Trump would make things worse. “I was kinda scared that Trump was going to f— it up,” Rocky said in his documentary “Stockholm Syndrome.”  “But on the other hand, I kinda was like, ‘That’s what’s up,’” he added. “I mean, you want the most support you [can get]. When the president supports you, I felt good. For the most part, I don’t think he ever knows what’s going on in the urban communities or the urban divisions of this political s—.”

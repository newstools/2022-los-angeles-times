Goodbye, airborne power naps to Northern California and snappy two-hours-or-less flights to Colorado and Arizona State. Time — in a couple years — for USC and UCLA athletes to strap up their neck pillows, take a trip to the campus bookstore for some quality in-flight reading and prepare for marathon trips across the country to Pennsylvania and Ohio. With Thursday morning’s news that the Trojans and Bruins are leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten Conference, travel and working with athletes’ class schedules may prove more difficult on road trips given the Big Ten’s location. Programs in the conference are centered on the East Coast, like Rutgers and Maryland, or clustered closer around the Great Lakes, like Northwestern and Michigan State.   Sports like football, which has the benefit of a week between games and simply play less often, will be easier to coordinate. But programs like USC baseball and UCLA softball — who played 53 and 61 games in 2022, respectively — may feel the brunt of travel. Beginning March 19 and ending May 8, the start of Pac-12 play this past season, UCLA  softball took four road trips against Washington, Stanford, Oregon State and Arizona State. That amounted to 12 days away in the span of less than two months. During the 2024-25 school year, two-hour journeys turn into nearly day-long trips, which will only increase the amount of time athletes spend away. Teams like USC volleyball, meanwhile, don’t have the benefit of staying in one location for multiple days for a series of games. Last season’s carousel included a trip to Colorado Nov. 5, then Utah Nov. 7, then Oregon Nov. 12 and Oregon State Nov. 14. Such a road trip could now include stops at Penn State, Rutgers and Maryland. Time for future recruits to get comfortable with typing their midterm papers amid the roar of a jet engine.

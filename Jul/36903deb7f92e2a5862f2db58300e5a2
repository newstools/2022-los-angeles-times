One person has died and another is hospitalized after a vehicle crashed into a bus stop in Elysian Park on Wednesday afternoon. Police and firefighters were called to the scene around 4:24 p.m. near North Broadway and Bernard Street, according to authorities. The Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed that one person died and another was taken to a trauma center in critical condition. The vehicle was traveling southbound on North Broadway when it jumped the curb and hit two men who were sitting on a bench, said Officer Matthew Cruz, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson. One of the victims was trapped under the vehicle, Cruz said. He did not have information about the driver, including whether they stayed at the scene and cooperated with investigators. Aerial footage from KTLA-TV Channel 5 showed a green Mercedes-Benz SUV crashed on a sidewalk, with wreckage pinned under its front end and a toppled bus stop sign leaning on its rear. Further information was not available Wednesday night.

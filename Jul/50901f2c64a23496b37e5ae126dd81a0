Even as gas prices across the nation continue to fall — dropping to the lowest point in the last month as of Monday — California rates still far outpace other states, according to the American Automobile Assn.  California prices are also decreasing, but the average price per gallon in the Golden State remains $0.37 or more above all other states’ averages, the AAA data show. The average price per gallon of regular-grade gas in California is $6.088, followed not-so-closely behind by Hawaii, at an average of $5.617 per gallon. Prices in California are noticeably down from earlier this summer, dropping about 5.3% from June 14, when the state’s average price was $6.438. But many states in the Southeast have seen prices drop much more quickly, according to an analysis of the AAA data.  South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi — which have the three lowest average gas prices in the U.S. as of Monday — have seen 6% to 9% decreases in gas prices over the last month, according to an analysis of AAA data. These three states are all averaging below $4.19 per gallon, according to the AAA. The U.S. average price for a regular-grade gallon is $4.67, down 12 cents over the last week and 34 cents from a month ago, according to the AAA. Despite an expected increase in demand for gas from  Fourth of July travel, industry experts say that falling oil prices continue to drive down fuel prices. “Less expensive oil usually means less expensive gas,” Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson, said in a statement.  But the national average price for gas is still $1.53 more than last July, AAA data show.  California’s Mono County, near the central Nevada border, leads the state in current prices, with an average of $7.01 a gallon, according to AAA. The average price in Los Angeles County is $6.148; in San Francisco it is $6.178; and in San Diego it is $6.077.

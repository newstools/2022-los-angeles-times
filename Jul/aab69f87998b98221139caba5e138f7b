A small brush fire that threatened homes Sunday in Diamond Bar in eastern Los Angeles County has been extinguished with no damage to any properties, an L.A. County fire official said. Firefighters were called to the scene about 1:30 p.m. and brought in additional crews as the flames neared homes. Two hours later, they had stopped the fire’s forward progress with hoses and water-dropping helicopters  after it burned about four acres off the 57 Freeway near Brea Canyon Cutoff Road, said Capt. Sarah Cortez. Ground crews remained on scene for mop-up operations to complete digging a line around the perimeter, she said.

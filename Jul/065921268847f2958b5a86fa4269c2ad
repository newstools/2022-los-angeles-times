Paraguayan international Andrés Cubas scored his first MLS goal in the 89th minute to give the Vancouver Whitecaps a 1-0 victory over LAFC on Saturday night. Cubas intercepted a clearing attempt, taking the ball off his chest at the top of the penalty area, and fired a right-footer past former Whitecaps goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau and into the bottom-left corner. Vancouver improved to 7-8-3. MLS-leading LAFC dropped to 11-4-3.  Crepeau made a save in his return to BC Place. Jeers and boos rained down on the 28-year-old Canadian nearly every time he touched the ball. Crepeau started 32 games for Vancouver between 2019 and 2021 but requested a trade ahead of the 2022 season because of what Whitecaps sporting director Axel Schuster has described as a “very personal situation.” Vancouver goalkeeper Cody Cropper did not have a save but recorded his fourth shutout of the season.
